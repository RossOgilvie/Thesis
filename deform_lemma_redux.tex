\section{Deformation Theory}
\label{sec:Deformation Theory}

\subsection{Whitham Deformations}
Let us consider infinitesimal deformations of the spectral data $(Σ,Θ^1,Θ^2)$, so called Whitham deformations. LIT REVIEW ABOUT WHITHAM DEFROMATIONS\todo{}. We have seen that the spectral data $(Σ,Θ^1,Θ^2)$ can be described concretely as follows. The marked curve $Σ$ is described by $η^2 = P(ζ)$, for $P$ a real polynomial of degree $2g+2$, and each differential can be described by a real polynomial $b$ of degree $g+3$. Thus, we consider the moduli space of spectral data $\mathcal{M}$ as a subspace of the affine space of polynomials $\R^{4g+11} = \R^{2g+3}\times\R^{g+4}\times\R^{g+4}$.

A deformation of spectral data is a path $\ell:(-ε,ε) \to \mathcal{M}$, paramterised by $t$. An infinitesimal deformation is the tangent vector of such a curve at $t=0$. We write $\ell(t) = (P(t),b^1(t),b^2(t))$ and $\ell(0) = (P,b^1,b^2)$. For every polynomial $P(t,ζ)$, the corresponding curve shall be denoted $Σ(t)$, with $Σ = Σ(0)$. More generally, omission of the parameter $t$ corersponds to evaluation at the point $t=0$. We shall use a dash to denote differentiation with respect to $ζ$ and a dot for differentiation with respect to $t$ evaluated at $t=0$.

We have seen that the differentials of the spectral data are the derivative of the logarithms of the eigenvalues $μ,\tilde{μ}$. With this in mind, introduce the notation $q^i$ for the functions $q^1 = \log μ$ and $q^2 = \log \tilde{μ}$, which are defined locally up to a constant. Because the differentials $Θ^i = dq^i$ have nonzero periods, it is not possible to extend these to global functions on $Σ$. For points along the curve $\ell$, by definition
\[
dq^i(t) = Θ^1(t) = \frac{1}{\zeta^2\eta}b^i(t,\zeta) d\zeta.
\]
The periods of the differentials of a triple of spectral data satify an integrality condition REF. Along a deformation, this forces the periods to take a fixed value. In particular then, their derivative with respect to $t$ is zero. Thus $\dot q^i$ is a well defined meromorphic function.

At a point of $Σ$ that is not a ramification point, a meromorphic function on $Σ(t)$ may be expanded as $(ζ-a)^k g(t,ζ-a)$, for a function $g$ holomorphic in its second parameter and nonvanishing at $g(0,0)$. As $ζ$ is independent of $t$, the order $k$ of this function is unchanged under differentiation by $t$. However, over a branch point $α$, we must use a local coordinate $ξ(t)^2 = ζ - α(t)$, for $α(t)$ a root of $P(t)$ and $α(0) = α$. A meromorphic function may be written locally as $ξ(t)^k g(t,ξ(t))$. Differentiating with respect to $t$ yields
\[
\left . \frac{d}{dt} ξ^k g(t,ξ) \right|_{t=0} = -\frac{k}{2} ξ^{k-2} \dot{α}g - \frac{1}{2}ξ^{k-1}\dot{α}g' + ξ^k \dot{g}.
\labelthis{eqn:pole order}
\]
As $dq^i$ has double poles without residues over $ζ=0,\infty$, it follows that $q^i$ has simple poles at those same points and is holomorphic at all other points. Applying \eqref{eqn:pole order} to $q^i$, we see that $\dot{q}^i$ may have simpe poles at the nonzero roots of $P$. If the curve $Σ$ is branched over $ζ=0,\infty$, then $\dot{q}^i$ may have a triple pole there. Otherwise $\dot{q}^i$ has at worst simple poles over $ζ=0\infty$.

A consequence of this is that $ζη\dot{q}^i$ is holomorphic. This is invariant under the hyperelliptic involution $σ$, so from REF MIRANDA, we may deduce that
\[
\dot{q}^i = \frac{1}{ζη}\hat{c}^i(ζ)
\]
for some degree $g+3$ polynomial $\hat{c}^i$. The eigenvalues satisfy $ρ^* μ = \bar{μ}^{-1}$. Applying $\log$ and differentiating with respect to $t$ shows that the polynomials $\hat{c}^i$ are imaginary. These polynomials encode the infinitesimal deformations of the differentials that preserve the periods.

Consider the closing condition in its integral form REF. For some consistent choice of $q^i$ along $γ_+$
\[
\int_{γ_+} dq^i = q^i(σ(ξ_1)) - q^i(ξ_1) \in 2π\iu \Z,
\]
where $ξ_1$ is one of the points in $Σ$ over $ζ=1$. Hence, just like for the periods, the derivative with respect to $t$ of this integral is zero. If we differentiate the above, we find that $\dot q^i(σ(ξ_1)) = \dot q^i(ξ_1)$. But
\[
\dot{q}^i(σ(ξ_1)) = σ^* \dot{q}^i (ξ_1) = - \dot{q}^i(ξ_1).
\]
Thus $\hat c^i$ has a factor of $ζ-1$. The same reasoning applied to $γ_-$ leads to a factor of $ζ+1$. Therefore let $\hat c^i(\zeta) = (\zeta^2 - 1) c^i(\zeta)$, for $c^i$ a real polynomial of degree $g+1$.

Naturally, there is a realtionship between the tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$ at a point and the polynomials $\hat{c}^i$. From the equality of mixed partial derivatives
\begin{align*}
\left . \frac{d}{dt} dq^i \right|_{t=0} &= \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta^2\eta}\left( -\frac{1}{2}\frac{\dot P}{P}b^i + \dot b^i \right) \\
d(\dot{q}^i) & = \frac{1}{\zeta^2\eta}\left( -\hat c^i -\frac{1}{2}\frac{P'}{P}\zeta\hat c^i + \zeta\hat {c^i}'\right)d\zeta \\
\dot P b^i - 2P\dot b^i &= 2P\left( \hat c^i - \zeta\hat {c}^{i\prime} \right) + P'\zeta\hat c^i \labelthis{eqn:EMPDi}
\end{align*}
This yields equations linking $\dot{b}^i$ to $\hat{c}^i$ for each of $i=1,2$. The two equations are not however independent of one another, for they both contain $P$ and its derivatives. If we multiply the equations by $\hat c^2$ and $\hat c^1$ respectively and take the difference, we arrive at
\[
\dot P (b^1\hat c^2 - b^2\hat c^1) =  2P(\dot b^1\hat c^2 - \dot b^2\hat c^1 - \zeta\hat {c^1}'\hat c^2 + \zeta\hat {c^2}'\hat c^1).\labelthis{eqn:diffed}
\]
We will prove that $P$ divides $b^1\hat c^2 - b^2\hat c^1$ by showing that it vanishes at every root of $P$. If $α$ is a root of $P$ and not a root of $\dot{P}$, we see it is a root of $b^1\hat c^2 - b^2 \hat c^1$ immediately from \eqref{eqn:diffed}. Suppose then that $P$ and $\dot P$ have a common root $α$. If $α=0$, then we know from REF that $b^i_0=0$ and so $ζ$ divides $b^i$. If $α\neq 0$, from \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} we have that
\begin{align*}
\dot P(α) b^i(α) &= 2P(α)\left( \dot b^i(α) + \hat c^i(α) - α\hat {c^i}'(α)\right) +P'(α)α\hat c^i(α) \\
0 &= 0 + P'(α)α\hat c^i(α)
\end{align*}
But the assumption that the spectral curve is nonsingular forces $P'(α)\neq 0$. Thus we may conclude that $\hat{c}^i(α)=0$. Hence $P$ divides $b^1\hat c^2 - b^2 \hat c^1$ and there is some degree four polynomial $\hat{Q}$ such that
\[
b^1 \hat{c}^2 - b^2 \hat{c}^1 = \hat{Q} P
\]
As $\zeta^2-1$ is a factor of both $\hat{c}$'s, and $P$ has no zeroes on the unit circle, it must be a factor of $\hat{Q}$. Define $\hat Q = (\zeta^2-1)Q$ to give
\[
b^1 c^2 - b^2 c^1 = Q P \labelthis{eqn:Q}
\]
for some real quadratic polynomial $Q$. This is a necessary condition that the polynomials $c^i$ must satisfy if they correspond to a tangent vector.

The construction of the polynomials $c^i$ took into account the order of the poles, the real structure, the periods and the closing conditions of the differenitals, but we have not considered the residue free condition. For that, we need $P_1(t)b^i_0(t) - 2P_0(t)b^i_1(t) = 0$ to hold at every point of the deformation $\ell$. Taking derivatives, we will need to show that
\[
\dot{P}_1 b^i_0 + P_1 \dot{b}^i_0 - 2 \dot{P}_0 b^i_1 - 2 P_0 \dot{b}^i_1 = 0 \labelthis{eqn:residueTangent}
\]
holds. In summary, any infinitesimal deformation of the spectral data (a tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$) gives rise to a pair of degree $g+1$ real polynomials $(c^1,c^2)$, which in turn yeild a real quadratic polynomial $Q$. Additionally, any tangent vector must also satisfy \eqref{eqn:residueTangent}.

To close this section, we consider whether at a given point $(P,b^1,b^2)$ the polynomials $\hat{c}^i$ and $Q$ are uniquely determined by a tangent vector $(\dot P, \dot b^1, \dot b^2)$. Since the equations \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} are linear in the components of the tangent vector, we need only consider this question for the zero tangent vector. But then,
\[
0 = 2P\left( \hat {c}^i - \zeta\hat {c}^{i\prime}\right) + P'\zeta\hat {c}^i = 2P\left[ (ζ^2-1) (c^i - ζc^{i\prime}) - 2ζ^2c^i \right] + ζ(ζ^2-1)P'c^i.
\]
The assumption of a nonsingular spectral curve requires that $P$ and $P'$ have no common factors. $P$ has at least $2g$ nonzero roots. Evaluation at any of these roots $α$ shows that $P'(α)α(α^2-1)c^i(α) = 0$, and hence $α$ is a root of $c^i$. And at the points $ζ = 1,-1$, $P(1)c^i(1) = P(-1)c^i(-1) = 0$, which similarly shows that these two points are roots of $c^i$. Hence the degree $g+1$ polynomial $c^i$ vanishes at $2g+2$ distinct points and thus it is the zero polynomial. This immediately implies that $Q=0$ also. So every real quadratic $Q$ is associated to at most one tangent vector to the space of spectral data.













\subsection{The Tangent Space to $\mathcal{M}$}
Above we saw how to distill an infinitesimal deformation into a real quadratic polynomial $Q$. In this section we will show how to do the reverse; for a given $Q$, generate a tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$. There are two steps to this process. Firstly, we construct polynomials $c^i$ solving \eqref{eqn:Q}. Then secondly, we separate the information about the deformation contained in $c^i$ into $\dot{b}^i$ and $\dot{P}$ using the equations \eqref{eqn:EMPDi}. One must however take account of the possibility of common factors, even though morally each case tells the same story.

Suppose that $\ell(t) = (P(t),b^1(t),b^2(t))$ is a path in the space of spectral data, and that at $t=0$ we have the following common factors
\[
\gcd(P,b^1,b^2) = F,\;\; \gcd(P/F,b^i/F) = F^i,\;\; \gcd(b^1/FF^1, b^2/FF^2) = G,
\labelthis{eqn:common factors}
\]
so that we may write
\[
P = F F^1 F^2 \tilde{P},\;\; b^i = F F^i G \tilde{b}^i.
\]
We denote the degrees of the polynomials $F, F^1, F^2$ and $G$ as $d_F,d_1,d_2$ and $d_G$ respectively. Inserting these factorisations into \eqref{eqn:EMPDi}, we observe that
\[
\dot{P} F F^i G \tilde{b}^i = 2 F F^1 F^2 \tilde{P} (\dot{b}^i + \hat{c}^i - ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}) + ζP' \hat{c}^i.
\]
Assuming that the spectral curve is nonsingular, $P'$ does not share any common factors with $P$. Hence we see that $FF^i$ divides $ζ\hat{c}^i$. We treat the conformal and nonconformal cases separately. Assume first that $P(0)\neq 0$, which corresponds to nonconformal harmonic map. Then $ζ$ is not a factor of $P$, so $FF^i$ divides $\hat{c}^i$. We write $\hat{c}^i = (ζ^2-1)FF^i\tilde{c}^i$. We then then remove the common factors from the above equation,
\[
\dot{P} G \tilde{b}^i - 2 F^j \tilde{P} \dot{b}^i = 2 F^j \tilde{P} (\hat{c}^i - ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}) + ζ(ζ^2-1)P' \tilde{c}^i,
\labelthis{eqn:EMPDi reduced}
\]
with $j\neq i$ (ie if $i=1$, then $j=2$). Inserting these expressions for $\hat{c}^i$ into the $Q$-equation \eqref{eqn:Q} on the other hand produces
\begin{align*}
FF^1G\tilde{b}^1 FF^2\tilde{c}^2 - FF^2G\tilde{b}^2 FF^1\tilde{c}^1 &= Q FF^1F^2\tilde{P} \\
FG\bra{\tilde{b}^1 \tilde{c}^2 - \tilde{b}^2 \tilde{c}^1} &= Q \tilde{P}
\end{align*}
By definition, neither $F$ nor $G$ divide $\tilde{P}$ so they must divide $Q$. This provides a limit on the number of coincident roots that are allowed; $Q$ is quadratic so $FG$ is degree two or less. Moreover, because all of $P,b^1,b^2$ are real, and $P$ has no roots on the unit circle, any common roots of the three polynomials must come in conjugate inverse pairs and so $F$ is even degree. Hence at most one of $G$ and $F$ is not trivial. We write $Q = FG\tilde{Q}$. With all these common factors removed, we have the equation
\[
\tilde{b}^1 \tilde{c}^2 - \tilde{b}^2 \tilde{c}^1 = \tilde{Q} \tilde{P}.
\labelthis{eqn:Q reduced}
\]

In the conformal case, we know that $P_0, b^1_0$ and $b^2_0$ all vanish at $t=0$. Thus $F$ includes a factor of $ζ$. We write $F = ζ\tilde{F}$. This time, we conclude that it is $\tilde{F}F^i$ that divides $\hat{c}^i$. The same reasoning as above then implies that $\tilde{F}G$ divides $Q$. However, the residue condition in this case simplifies in a way that forces another constraint on $Q$. At $t=0$, \eqref{eqn:residueTangent} becomes
\[
P_1 \dot{b}_0 - 2 \dot{P}_0 b_1 = 0.
\]
The linear degree of equation \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} reads
\[
\dot P_0 b_1^i - 2P_1\dot b_0^i = 3P_1\hat{c}_0^i.
\]
Combining these two expressions shows that
\[
3P_1\hat{c}_0^i = \dot P_0 b_1^i - 4\dot{P}_0 b_1^i = -3\dot{P}_0 b_1^i.
\]
Substituting this into the linear degree of \eqref{eqn:Q}, we finally arrive at
\begin{align*}
Q_0 P_1 &= b^1_1 c^2_0 - b^2_1 c^1_0 \\
Q_0 (P_1)^2 &= b^1_1 (P_1 c^2_0) - b^2_1 (P_1 c^1_0) \\
&= b^1_1 (\dot{P}_0 b^2_1) - b^2_1 (\dot{P}_0 b^1_1) = 0.
\end{align*}
A spectral curve must be nonsingular at $ζ=0$, so if $P_0=0$ we can be sure that $P_1\neq 0$. Hence $Q_0$ must vanish. As $Q$ is a real quadratic polynomial, it must be of the form $Q=Q_1 ζ$ for some real number $Q_1$. Immediately then $\tilde{F} = G = 1$, as neither $P$ nor the polynomials $b^i$ are permitted to have multiple roots at $ζ=0$.

Thus we have divided our analysis into four cases; conformal or nonconformal, and within the nonconformal case whether $F$, $G$ or neither is nontrivial. The points in the nonconformal case where $F$ is nontrivial represent singular points in the vector fields of infinitesimal deformations and are not considered further in this chapter. Let
\[
U = \Set{ (P,b^1,b^2) \in \R^{4g+11} } { \gcd(P,b^1,b^2) = 1, \gcd(P,P')=1 }.
\]
Henceforth we shall in consider $\mathcal{M} \cap U$. That leaves three cases. In each case, $F^i$ must divide $c^i$ and $G$ must divide $Q$.

It will not always be possible to solve for a tangent vector given an arbitrary quadratic polynomial $Q$. Consider \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} at the $k$ distinct roots of $\tilde{b}^2$, for $k \leq \deg \tilde{b}^2 = g + 3 - (d_F + d_2 + d_G)$. It is a linear system in the coefficients of $\tilde{c}^1$. If $\tilde{b}^2$ has higher order roots, then we may differentiate with respect to $ζ$ to obtain further relations. Let these $k$ distinct roots be denoted $β_i$ and have multiplicities $r_i$. Suppose that $\tilde{c}^2$ were degree $n := g + 2 - (d_F + d_2 + d_G)$. The system of equations is
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & β_1 & (β_1)^2 & \cdots & (β_1)^{r_1-1} & \cdots & (β_1)^{n} \\
0 & 1 & 2β_1 & \cdots & (r_1-1)(β_1)^{r_1-2} & \cdots & n(β_1)^{n-1} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \cdots & \frac{n!}{(n+1 - r_1)!}(β_1)^{n+1-r_1} \\
1 & β_2 & (β_2)^2 & \cdots & (β_2)^{r_2-1} & \cdots & (β_2)^{n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \cdots & \frac{n!}{(n+1 - r_2)!}(β_2)^{n+1-r_2} \\
1 & β_3 & (β_3)^2 & \cdots & (β_3)^{r_2-1} & \cdots & (β_3)^{n} \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots & & \vdots & & \vdots \\
0 & 0 & 0 & \cdots & 1 & \cdots & \frac{n!}{(n+1 - r_k)!}(β_k)^{n+1-r_k} \\
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{c}^2_0 \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_1 \\~\\ \vdots \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_n
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
h(β_1) \\ h'(β_1) \\ \vdots \\ h^{(r_1-1)(β_1)} \\
h(β_2) \\ \vdots \\ h^{(r_2-1)(β_2)} \\
h(β_3) \\ \vdots \\ \vdots \\ h^{(r_k-1)(β_k)} \\
\end{bmatrix},
\]
where
\[
h(ζ) := \frac{\tilde{Q}(ζ)\tilde{P}(ζ)}{\tilde{b}^1(ζ)},
\]
which is holomorphic at every root $β_i$, as $\tilde{b}^1(β_i)\neq 0$.

The $(n+1)\times (n+1)$ coefficient matrix on the left is called the confluent Vandermonde matrix at the roots of $\tilde{b}^2$, and we shall denote it $V(\tilde{b}^2)$. Let the column vector on the right hand side be denoted $\mathbf{h}(\tilde{P},\tilde{Q},\tilde{b}^1;\tilde{b}^2)$. A confluent Vandermonde matrix is always nonsingular REF, therefore there is a unique solution to this equation. But we see that in general the solution $\tilde{c}^2$ is degree $n$. But $c^2$ must be degree $g+1$, and $c^2 = F^2\tilde{c}^2 $ forces $\deg \tilde{c}^2 = g+1 - d_2 = n-1 + d_F + d_G$.
If both of $F$ and $G$ are one, then the solution is a degree larger than we require. Thus, we must introduce a constraint in our choice of $Q$ to reduce the degree of the solution. Likewise, evaluating \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} at the roots of $\tilde{b}^1$ leads to a solution $\tilde{c}^1$ of degree $g+2 - (d_F + d_2 + d_G)$. From the highest order term of \eqref{eqn:Q reduced}, if $\tilde{c}^2$ is has been reduced to degree $n-1$, then $\tilde{c}^1$ will be degree $g + 1 - d_1$ without any further restrictions.

We define at any point $(P,b^1,b^2)$ of $\mathcal{M}$ with $F=G=1$ and for any real quadratic polynomial $Q$ the function $R((P,b^1,b^2),Q)$ to be the dot product of the last row of $V(\tilde{b}^2)^{-1}$ with the vector $\mathbf{h}(\tilde{P},\tilde{Q},\tilde{b}^1;\tilde{b}^2)$. When the point of $\mathcal{M}$ is understood, we shall abbreviate this to $R(Q)$. $R$ is simply the function that gives the value of $\tilde{c}^2_n$; the condition that $R((P,b^1,b^2),Q) = 0$ is equivalent to the condition that there is a solution to \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} of degree $n-1$ when $F=G=1$. It is important to note that $R$ is linear function in the coefficients of $Q$.

Further, $R$ satifies a reality type condition. We shall demonstrate this property first at points where the roots of $\tilde{b}^2$ are distinct.
Let $\tilde{b}^2$ have $n+1 = g+3 - d_2$ distinct roots $β_i$. In this case, the form of the solution to the system of equations REF is elegant. Consider the Langrange polynomials at the roots of $\tilde{b}^2$,
\[
L_i (ζ) := \prod_{j \neq i} \frac{ζ-β_j}{β_i - β_j}.
\]
Each of these polynomials is degree $n$ and has the property that $L_i (β_j) = δ_{ij}$. The unique degree $n$ polynomial solving the system of equations is
\[
\tilde{c}^2(ζ) = \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} h(β_i) L_i (ζ),
\]
and in particular the highest coefficent is
\[
R = \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} h(β_i) \prod_{j \neq i} \bra{ β_i - β_j }^{-1}.
\]
Because $\tilde{b}^2$ is a real polynomial, its set of roots is invariant under $ζ \mapsto \cji{ζ}$. This creates an involution on the set of roots. Let $τ$ be such that $β_{τ(i)} = \cji{β}_i$. Note that
\[
\bar{h(β_i)}
= \bar{\frac{Q(β_i)\tilde{P}(β_i)}{\tilde{b}^1(β_i)}}
= \bar{β}_i^{g+1 - d_2} \frac{\tilde{Q}(\cji{β}_i)\tilde{P}(\cji{β}_i)}{\tilde{b}^1(\cji{β}_i)}
= \bar{β}_i^{n-1} h(β_{τ(i)})
\]
and
\begin{align*}
\prod_{j \neq i} \bra{ \bar{β}_i - \bar{β}_j }^{-1}
= \prod_{j \neq i} \cji{β}_i \cji{β}_j \bra{ \cji{β}_j - \cji{β}_i }^{-1}
= \bra { \cji{β}_i }^{n} \bra{ \prod_{j \neq i}  β_{τ(j)}} (-1)^{n} \prod_{j \neq i}\bra{ β_{τ(i)} - β_{τ(j)} }^{-1}
\end{align*}
so that the conjugate of $R$ is
\begin{align*}
\bar{R}
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} \bar{h(β_i)} \prod_{j \neq i} \bra{ \bar{β}_i - \bar{β}_j }^{-1} \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&= \sum_{i = 1}^{n+1} h(β_{τ(i)})
\cji{β}_i \bra{ \prod_{j \neq i}  β_{τ(j)}} (-1)^{n} \prod_{j \neq i}\bra{ β_{τ(i)} - β_{τ(j)} }^{-1} \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&= (-1)^{n}\bra{ \prod_{i=1}^{n+1}  β_i }  R.
\labelthis{eqn:R reality}
\end{align*}

To extend this argument to the points where the roots of $\tilde{b}^2$ are not distinct, suppose that we are at a point $p$ of $U$ where $\tilde{b}^2$ has a double root $β$. Holding $F^2$ fixed, we may find a sequence of points $p_k = (P(p_k, ζ), b^1(p_k,ζ), b^2(p_k,ζ))$ converging to $p$ where $\gcd(P(p_k),b^2(p_k))$ is $F^2$ and the roots of each polynomial $\tilde{b}^2(p_k)$ are distinct. Identify the two simple roots $β_1(k),β_2(k)$ of $\tilde{b}^2(p_k)$ that collasce at $p$ to form the double root $β$. In other words, the two roots such that $\lim_{k\to\infty} β_1(p_k) = \lim_{k\to\infty} β_2(p_k) = β$. The corresponding rows of the Vandermonde matrix $V(\tilde{b}^2(p_k))$ are
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & β_1 & (β_1)^2 & \cdots & (β_1)^{k} & \cdots & (β_1)^{n} \\
1 & β_2 & (β_2)^2 & \cdots & (β_2)^{k} & \cdots & (β_2)^{n} \\
&&&\vdots&&&
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{c}^2_0 \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_1 \\~\\ \vdots \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_n
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
h(β_1) \\
h(β_2) \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
Performing elementary row operations does not change the solution to this system, and so we may subtract the first row from the second and scale it by $(β_2-β_1)^{-1}$. This gives
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
1 & β_1 & (β_1)^2 & \cdots & (β_1)^{k} & \cdots & (β_1)^{n} \\
0 & 1 & β_2+β_1 & \cdots & \sum_{i=0}^{k-1}(β_1)^i(β_2)^{k-1-i} & \cdots & \sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(β_1)^i(β_2)^{n-1-i} \\
&&&\vdots&&&
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
\tilde{c}^2_0 \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_1 \\~\\ \vdots \\~\\ \tilde{c}^2_n
\end{bmatrix}
=
\begin{bmatrix}
h(β_1) \\
\frac{h(β_2) - h(β_1)}{β_2 - β_1} \\
\vdots
\end{bmatrix}.
\]
The limit of the above as $k \to \infty$ is precisely the confluent Vandermonde matrix at $\tilde{b}^2(p_0)$. The calculation for higher order roots is similar. Combining this with the fact that inversion of a matrix is continuous and that the roots of a polynomial are continuous functions of coefficients (Viete map, track down reference in Whitney Complex Analytic Varieties \todo{ref}), this shows that limit of the solution $\tilde{c}^2(p_k)$ is just the solution $\tilde{c}^2(p)$. In particular, $R(p,Q)$ is the last component of this solution, and so is also the limit of $R(p_k,Q)$ as $k\to\infty$. This shows that \eqref{eqn:R reality} holds at all points of $U$ where $F=G=1$. From this reality condition, it follows that $R(Q)=0$ only puts one real constraint on $Q$, and so at any point of $U$ where $F=G=1$ there is a two (real) dimensional plane of real quadratic polynomials $Q$ that satisfy $R(Q) = 0$.

Let us return to the general situation now. Another obstacle to reconstrucitng a tangent vector from a given $Q$ is that the polynomials $c^i$ and $\dot{P},\dot{b}^i$ must be real. Let us now establish that if a solution of the appropriate degree exists, then there will be a real solution of the same degree. Suppose that we have a polynomial equation $AX - BY = C$, for some real polynomials $A,B,C$ of degrees $a,b,c$ respectively. Further suppose that solutions $X,Y$ exist of degrees $c-a$ and $c-b$ respectively. Then observe
\begin{align*}
C(ζ) &= ζ^c \bar{ C(\cji{ζ})}
= ζ^{c}\bar{A(\cji{ζ})} \bar{X(\cji{ζ})} - ζ^{c}\bar{B(\cji{ζ})} \bar{Y(\cji{ζ})}
= A(ζ) ζ^{c-a}\bar{X(\cji{ζ})} - B(ζ) ζ^{c-b}\bar{Y(\cji{ζ})} \\
C(ζ)
&= A(ζ) \frac{1}{2}\bra{ X(ζ) + ζ^{c-a}\bar{X(\cji{ζ})}} - B(ζ) \frac{1}{2}\bra{ Y(ζ) + ζ^{c-b}\bar{Y(\cji{ζ})}} ,
\end{align*}
which demonstrates the existence of real solutions.

As each of $b^1,b^2,P$ and $Q$ are real, \eqref{eqn:Q} will have real solutions. It is not obvious that the right hand side of \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} is real however. In particular, we must see how to take the real involution of a derivative. To do so, we compute the following, supposing $f$ is real of degree $k$
\begin{align*}
ζ^k \bar{f}(ζ^{-1}) &= f(ζ) \\
kζ^{k-1} \bar{f}(ζ^{-1}) - ζ^{k-2} \bar{f}'(ζ^{-1}) &= f'(ζ) \\
ρ^*(ζf') = ζ^{k-1}\bar{f}'(ζ^{-1}) &= k f(ζ) - ζf'(ζ).
\end{align*}
Thus we can compute the involution of the right hand side of \eqref{eqn:EMPDi}.
\begin{align*}
ρ^*\bra{ 2P\hat{c}^i - 2Pζ\hat{c}^{i\prime} + ζP'\hat{c}^i }
&= -2P\hat{c}^i - 2P\bra{-(g+3)\hat{c}^i + ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}} - \bra{(2p+2)P - ζP'}\hat{c}^i \\
&= (-2+2g+6-2g-2)P\hat{c}^i - 2Pζ\hat{c}^{i\prime} + ζP'\hat{c}^i \\
&= 2P\hat{c}^i - 2Pζ\hat{c}^{i\prime} + ζP'\hat{c}^i
\end{align*}
Remarkably then, this is a real polynomial.

Finally, in some circumstances, we will need to describe the set of solutions of $AX-BY=C$. Consider the related equation $AX-BY = 0$. If $X$ is a solution, then by evaluating at the roots of $B$ we see that $B$ divides $X$. Return now to the equation $AX-BY=C$ and suppose then that $(X,Y)$ is a solution. If $(X',Y')$ is any other solution, then $A(X-X') - B(Y-Y') = 0$. Therefore $X-X' = r B$ and $Y-Y' = rA$ for some polynomial $r$. Conversely, given any solution $(X,Y)$, it is clear that $(X+rB,Y+rA)$ is again a solution for every polynomial $r$.

Before we proceed to the results, it may be prudent to make a comment about the notational choices that have been made. We have attempted to use ligatures in a consistent way to indicate the factors that a polynomial does or does not have. For example, a hat indicates a factor of $ζ^2-1$, and a tilde indicates that common factors have been removed. Bold will signify a particular solution to an equation. The choice of this particular solution may or may not be unique. When a solution to an equation appears without bold, it signifies any solution from the set of potential solutions. We recall that $d_F, d_1, d_2$ and $d_G$ represent the degrees of the polynomials $F,F^1,F^2$ and $G$ respectively. Given a pair of polynomials $(X,Y)$, we also give their degrees as a pair $(x,y)$, for $x=\deg X$ and $y=\deg Y$. Finally, we shall use $i$ and $j$ for indices ranging over $\{1,2\}$, with the understanding that they are not equal. For example, if $i=1$, then we take $j=2$ and vice versa.




\begin{lem}[Nonconformal, $F=G=1$]
Take a triple of spectral data $(P,b^1,b^2)\in\mathcal{M}$ associated with a nonconformal harmonic map, with a nonsingular spectral curve given by $η^2 = P$ of genus $g$. Suppose that, with reference to \eqref{eqn:common factors}, $F=G=1$. For every $Q$ with $R(Q) = 0$, there exist unique real polynomials $c^i$ of degree $g+1$ that satisfy \eqref{eqn:Q} and, further, there is a unique tangent vector $(\dot P, \dot b^1, \dot b^2)$ to the space of spectral data $\mathcal{M}$.

\begin{proof}
In order to solve \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} or \eqref{eqn:Q}, one must first solve their reduced counterparts \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced} and \eqref{eqn:Q reduced}.

We consider \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} as a linear system on the coefficents of $\tilde{c}^i$ as above by making use of the confluent Vandermonde matrix. Thus there is a unique solution $({\bf \tilde{c}}^1, {\bf \tilde{c}}^2)$ of degrees $(g+2-d_1, g+2-d_2)$, where $d_i = \deg F^i$. We note that ${\bf\tilde{c}}^1_{g+2-d_1}$ is $R(Q)$ by definition, which by assumption is zero. By consideration of the leading order of \eqref{eqn:Q reduced}, if ${\bf\tilde{c}}^1_{g+2-d_1}$ vanishes, so too must ${\bf\tilde{c}}^2_{g+2-d_2}$. Multiplying \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} through by $F^1F^2$, we arrive at unique solutions $c^i = F^i {\bf\tilde{c}}^i$ for \eqref{eqn:Q}. Both of these polynomials are degree $g+1$. We similiarly define $\hat{c}^i = (ζ^2 -1)c^i$.

Next we must solve \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced}, for which \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} was a necessary condition.
\[
\dot{P} \tilde{b}^i - 2 F^j \tilde{P} \dot{b}^i = 2 F^j \tilde{P} (\hat{c}^i - ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}) + ζ(ζ^2-1)P' \tilde{c}^i.
\labelthis{eqn:EMPDi nc FG=1}
\]
This too can be solved using a (confluent) Vandermonde matrix, if $\tilde{b}^i$ is nonvanishing at the roots of $F^j \tilde{P}$ and vice versa. But by definition they are coprime. This was why it was necessary to force $c^i$ to have $F^i$ as a factor, so that the common factor $F^1$ of $b^i$ and $P$ could be removed from \eqref{EMPDi}.

One should be concerned that the two equations for $i=1,2$ may give different solutions for $\dot P$, and indeed in general they do. However, neither of the equations have unique solutions, and we shall use the freedom in the choice solution to find a common solution to both. Let a solution to each equation \eqref{eqn:eqn:EMPDi nc FG=1} be $({\bf \dot{P}}^1, {\bf \dot{b}}^1)$ and $({\bf \dot{P}}^2, {\bf \dot{b}}^2)$. The sets of solutions are
\[
\Set { ({\bf \dot{P}}^1 + 2rF^2\tilde{P}, {\bf \dot{b}}^1 + r\tilde{b}^1 } )
{ r \text{ a real polynomial of degree } d_1 },
\]
and
\[
\Set { ({\bf \dot{P}}^2 + 2sF^1\tilde{P}, {\bf \dot{b}}^2 + r\tilde{b}^2 } )
{ s \text{ a real polynomial of degree } d_2 },
\]
respectively. First note that every element of both of these sets are in agreement at any root $α$ of $\tilde{P}$. From \eqref{eqn:EMPDi nc FG=1},
\[
\dot P^i(α) \tilde{b}^i(α) = α(α^2 -1) P'(α) \tilde{c}^i(α).
\]
By definition, roots of $\tilde{P}$ are roots of $P$ that are not common to either $\tilde{b}^1$ or $\tilde{b}^2$. From \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} we see that
\[
\tilde{b}^1(α)\tilde{c}^2(α) - \tilde{b}^2(α)\tilde{c}^1(α) = Q(α)\tilde{P}(α) = 0,
\]
and thus
\[
\dot P^1(α)
= α (α^2 - 1) P'(α) \frac{\tilde{c}^1(α)}{\tilde{b}^1(α)}
= α (α^2 - 1) P'(α) \frac{\tilde{c}^2(α)}{\tilde{b}^2(α)}
= \dot P^2(α).
\]
At the $d_1$ roots of $F^1$, we see that every solution $\dot{P}^2$ takes the same value. Let $β$ be such a root, then
\[
\dot{P}^2(β)
= {\bf \dot{P}}^2(β) + 2sF^1(β)\tilde{P}(β)
= {\bf \dot{P}}^2(β)
= β (β^2-1) P'(β) \frac{\tilde{c}^2(β)}{\tilde{b}^2(β)},
\]
where we can be sure that $\tilde{b}^2(β) \neq 0$ because it cannot be a root of $b^2$ (if it were, $F\neq 1$). Also, $β$ is not a root of $\tilde{P}$ or $F^2$ by the assumption of nonsingularity. Thus this provides a constraint on the choice of $r$. Specifically we require that
\[
{\bf \dot{P}}^1(β) + 2r(β)F^2(β)\tilde{P}(β) = β (β^2-1) P'(β) \frac{\tilde{c}^2(β)}{\tilde{b}^2(β)}.
\]
Likewise, at the $d_2$ roots of $F^2$, we aquire constraints on the choice of $s$. It is always possible to meet these constraints (because, for example, the degree of $s$ is $d_2$ and there are only $d_2$ roots of $F^2$), so we see that there is common solution $({\bf \dot{P}}, {\bf \dot{b}}^1, {\bf \dot{b}}^2)$ to \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced}. It is also a solution to \eqref{eqn:EMPDi}.

This solution is still not unique; there remains one degree of freedom. For any real number $s$, we have solutions to \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} of the form
\begin{align*}
\dot P &= {\bf \dot{P}} + 2sP  \labelthis{eqn:P soln}\\
\dot b^i &= {\bf \dot{b}}^i + sb^i
\end{align*}
However, this freedom is simply the freedom to rescale $P$. We have chosen a preferred scaling of $P$, so our choice of $s$ is determined. Explicitly, if we were to allow other scalings, the formula for $P$ would be
\[
P(t) = r(t) \prod_i (ζ-α_i(t))(1- \bar{α}_i(t)ζ),
\]
where $α_i$ are the roots inside the unit circle and $r(t)$ is some real function. Then from any solution $\dot{P}$ we can determine the derivatives of the roots $α_i$ at $t=0$. Simply differentiate $P$ and evaluate at $α_i$
\begin{align*}
\dot{P} = \dot{r} \prod_i (ζ-α_i)(1- \bar{α}_iζ) + r(0) \sum_i (-\dot{α} &+ (\dot{α}\bar{α}+α\dot{\bar{α}})ζ - \dot{\bar{α}}ζ^2) \prod_{j\neq i} (ζ-α_j)(1- \bar{α}_jζ)
\labelthis{eqn:rescale P} \\
\dot{P}(α_i) &= -\dot{α}_i(1+α_i\bar{α}_i) \prod_{j\neq i} (α_i-α_j)(1- \bar{α}_j α_i).
\end{align*}
Thus we know the values of $\dot{α}_i$, independent of choice of $s$ in our solution \eqref{eqn:P soln}, because any two solutions $\dot{P}$ differ by a multiple of $P$, which vanishes at every root $α_i$. Alternatively, if we take the lowest order of \eqref{eqn:rescale P},
\[
\dot{P}_0 = \dot {\bf P}_0 + 2sP_0 = \dot r P_0 + \sum_i (-\dot{α}_i)\prod_i (-α_j),
\]
so we may ensure that $r\equiv 1$ by choosing $s$ so that $\dot r = 0$. In short, if we fix a scaling of the spectral curve, then there is a unique solution to \eqref{eqn:EMPDi}.

Finally then there is a second necessary condition that must be satisfied by our solution $(\dot{P},\dot{b}^1,\dot{b}^2)$. We must satisfy \eqref{eqn:residueTangent}, so that \eqref{eqn:residue} holds along the path. But this condition is satisfied already. Observe
\begin{align*}
\dot{P}_1 b_0 + P_1 \dot{b}_0 - 2(\dot{P}_0 b_1 + P_0 \dot{b}_1)
&= P_1\dot{b}_0 - 2\dot{P}_0b_1 + 3P_1\hat{c}_0 - P_0\dot{b}_1 + 2P_1\dot{b}_0 \\
&= 3\bra{ P_1\dot{b}_0 - \dot{P}_0b_1 + P_1\hat{c}_0} \\
&= \frac{3}{P_0}\bra{ P_0P_1\dot{b}_0 - P_0\dot{P}_0b_1 + P_1\bra{ \frac{1}{2}\dot{P_0}b_0 - P_0\dot{b_0} }} \\
&= \frac{3\dot{P}_0}{P_0}\bra{ - P_0b_1 + \frac{1}{2}P_1b_0 }\\
&= 0
\end{align*}
The substitution in the first line comes from the $ζ^1$ terms of \eqref{eqn:Q}, the third line from the constant terms of \eqref{eqn:Q} and the last line comes from the fact that the quantity in the bracket is exactly the residue at $ζ=0$, which is zero by the assumption that $(b^1,b^2,P)$ lies in $\mathcal{M}$, the space of spectal data.

Hence $(\dot{P},\dot{b}^1,\dot{b}^2)$ is a tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$ at $(b^1,b^2,P)$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}










\begin{lem}[Nonconformal, $G\neq1$]
Take a triple of spectral data $(P,b^1,b^2)$ associated with a nonconformal harmonic map, with a nonsingular spectral curve given by $η^2 = P$ of genus $g$. Suppose that, with reference to \eqref{eqn:common factors}, $G$ is a nonconstant real polynomial and $F=1$. If $G$ is linear, then for every real linear polynomial $\tilde{Q}$, or if $G$ is quadratic then for every pair of real numbers $(\tilde{Q},r)$, there is a unique tangent vector $(\dot P, \dot b^1, \dot b^2)$ to the space of spectral data $\mathcal{M}$.

\begin{proof}
This case, and the case to follow are similar to the first proof. We proceed by first solving the reduced equations \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced} and \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} and using the solutions to those equations to establish solutions to \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} and \eqref{eqn:Q}. Regardless of the degree of $G$, which we shall denote $d_G$, we know that we must set $Q = G\tilde{Q}$. \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} reads
\[
\tilde{b}^1\tilde{c}^2 - \tilde{b}^2\tilde{c}^1 = \tilde{Q}\tilde{P}.
\]
There is a solution to this equation $({\bf \tilde{c}}^1,{\bf \tilde{c}}^2)$ of degree $(g+2-d_1-d_G,g+2-d_2-d_G)$. If we multiply these by $F^1$ and $F^2$ respectively, we have solutions to \eqref{eqn:Q} of degree $g+2-d_G$ each. If $G$ is linear therefore, this is the unique solution of degree $g+1$, but if $G$ is quadratic the space of solutions to \eqref{eqn:Q} is
\[
\Set { (F^1{\bf \tilde{c}}^1 + rF^1\tilde{b}^1, F^2{\bf \tilde{c}}^1 + rF^2\tilde{b}^2 }
{ r \text{ a real scalar} }.
\]
Hence for every $r\in\R$ there is a solution $(c^1, c^2)$. In either case, it was not necessary to have a condition similar to $R(Q)=0$, but conversely the choice of $Q$ was resticted by $Q = \tilde{Q}$.

Next we must solve \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced}, but the proof above applies again, essentially without modification.
\[
\dot{P} G \tilde{b}^i - 2 F^j \tilde{P} \dot{b}^i = 2 F^j \tilde{P} (\hat{c}^i - ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}) + ζ(ζ^2-1)P' \tilde{c}^i,
\labelthis{eqn:EMPDi nc G}
\]
This has a solution because $\gcd(F^j\tilde{P},G\tilde{b}^i) = 1$. Analysis at the roots of $F^1F^2\tilde{P}$ and a choice of scaling for $P$ forces a unique common solution $({\bf \dot{P}}, {\bf \dot{b}}^1, {\bf \dot{b}}^2)$. This solution also satisfies \eqref{eqn:residueTangent}. Hence it is a tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$ at $(b^1,b^2,P)$.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}





\begin{lem}[Conformal]
Take a triple of spectral data $(P,b^1,b^2)$ associated with a conformal harmonic map, with a nonsingular spectral curve given by $η^2 = P$ of genus $g$. Then for every pair of real numbers $(Q_1,r)$, there is a unique tangent vector to the space of spectral data $(\dot P, \dot b^1, \dot b^2)$.

\begin{proof}
Recall that the condition for a triple of spectral data to be associated to a conformal harmonic map is that the spectral curve is branched over $ζ=0,\infty$. Thus $P$ is degree $2g+1$ and $P(0)=0$. From \eqref{eqn:Residue}, or directly by consideration of the order of the poles, $b^i_0 = 0$ also. We may write therefore that $P= ζF^1F^2\tilde{P}$ and $b^i = ζF^i \tilde{b}^i$, where $\tilde{P}$ is a real polynomial of degree $2g - d_1 - d_2$ and both $b^i$ are real polynomials of degree $g+1-d_i$.

Factoring these common roots, \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} is simply
\[
\tilde{b}^1 \tilde{c}^2 - \tilde{b}^2 \tilde{c}^1 = ζQ_1\tilde{P}.
\labelthis{eqn:Q conformal}
\]
This is similar to the above case where $G$ was quadratic. The space of solutions is
\[
\Set { ({\bf \tilde{c}}^1 + r \tilde{b}^1, {\bf \tilde{c}}^2 + r \tilde{b}^1) }{ r\in \R },
\]
where $({\bf \tilde{c}}^1,{\bf \tilde{c}}^2)$ is a solution of degrees $(g+1-d_1, g+1-d_2)$. For every such solution, let $c^i = F^i\tilde{c}^i$ and consider the corresponding \eqref{eqn:EMPDi reduced}, namely
\[
\dot{P} \tilde{b}^i - 2 F^j \tilde{P} \dot{b}^i = 2 F^j \tilde{P} (\hat{c}^i - ζ\hat{c}^{i\prime}) + (ζ^2-1)P' \tilde{c}^i,
\labelthis{eqn:EMPDi conformal}
\]
In what is by now a familiar story, for the dotted quatities there is a common solution $({\bf \dot{P}}, {\bf \dot{b}}^1, {\bf \dot{b}}^2)$. The space of solutions is however
\[
\Set{
({\bf \dot P} + 2s F^1F^2\tilde{P}, {\bf \dot b}^1 + s F^1\tilde{b}^1, {\bf \dot b}^2 + s F^2\tilde{b}^2)
}{ s \text { a real quadratic polynomial} }.
\]
Thus there appears not to be a unique tangent vector corresponding to each choice $(Q,r)$. However, unlike the previous two cases, the condition \eqref{eqn:residueTangent} is not automatically true. Let $s = s_0 + s_1ζ + \bar{s}_0 ζ^2$. For $i=1$, we see that the condition implies that
\[
2 {\bf\dot{P}}_0 b^1_1 - P_1 {\bf \dot{b}}^1_0 + 3 s_0 P_1 b^1_1 = 0
\]
which fully determines $s_0$. Can we therefore simultaneously satisfy the condition for $i=2$? Note that \eqref{eqn:EMPDi conformal} in the lowest degree reads
\[
\dot{P}_0 b^i_1 - 2P_1\dot{b}^i_0 = -3 P_1 c^i_0
\]
and \eqref{eqn:Q conformal} in the lowest degree yields
\begin{align*}
b^1_1 c^2_0 &= b^2_1 c^1_0 \\
b^1_1 \bra{{\bf\dot{P}_0} b^2_1 - 2P_1{\bf\dot{b}^2_0}} &= b^2_1 \bra{{\bf\dot{P}_0} b^1_1 - 2P_1{\bf\dot{b}^1_0}} \\
2b^1_1 {\bf\dot{b}^2_0} &= 2 b^2_1 {\bf\dot{b}^1_0} \\
~\\
b^1_1 \bra{2 {\bf\dot{P}_0} b^2_1 - P_1 {\bf \dot{b}^2_0} + 3 s_0 P_1 b^2_1}
&= 2 {\bf\dot{P}_0} b^1_1b^2_1 - P_1 b^1_1{\bf \dot{b}^2_0} + 3 s_0 P_1 b^1_1b^2_1 \\
&= 2 {\bf\dot{P}_0} b^1_1b^2_1 + P_1 b^2_1 {\bf\dot{b}^1_0} + 3 s_0 P_1 b^1_1b^2_1 \\
&= b^2_1\bra{2 {\bf\dot{P}_0} b^1_1 - P_1 {\bf\dot{b}^1_0} + 3 s_0 P_1 b^1_1 } \\
&= 0
\end{align*}
So the condition holds for $i=2$ also. Having passed this check, there is still one free parameter, namely for any $Q_1$ and $r$, the corresponding tangent vectors are
\[
\Set {
({\bf \dot P} + 2(s_0+\bar{s}_0ζ^2) F^1F^2\tilde{P} + 2s_1ζ F^1F^2\tilde{P}, {\bf \dot b^1} + (s_0+\bar{s}_0ζ^2) F^1\tilde{b}^1 + s_1ζ F^1\tilde{b}^1, {\bf \dot b^2} + (s_0+\bar{s}_0ζ^2) F^2\tilde{b}^2 + s_1ζ F^2\tilde{b}^2)
}{ s_1 \in \R }.
\]
But our free choice of $s_1\in\R$ is only adding multiples of $(2P,b^1,b^2)$, which as in the nonconformal case is a rescaling of the spectral curve, and so also determined.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

Though the details of the above three lemmata vary, we see that in every case they tell essentially the same story: starting with a polynomial $Q$ it is possible to recover a tangent vector to $\mathcal{M}$. We have already seen that no two tangent vectors give the same $Q$, so this pairing is a bijection. It is also interesting to note that in each case, there was a choice of two real parameters. In the nonconformal $F=G=1$ case, this is because $R(Q) = 0$ provides just one real constraint on the choice of real quadratic $Q$, for which we could have otherwise chosen $Q_0 \in \C$ and $Q_1\in \R$. Thus is seems natural to identify the tangent space to $\mathcal{M}$ with these two real parameters, which would suggest that $\mathcal{M}$ itself was a surface.

\begin{thm}
The open subset of $\mathcal{M}$ where $\gcd(P,b^1,b^2)$ divides $ζ$ is a two dimensional manifold.

\begin{proof}
The open subset of $\mathcal{M}$ where $\gcd(P,b^1,b^2)$ divides $ζ$ is another description for the space $\mathcal{M}\cap U$. Consider the map $F$ defined on a small simply connected subset $V$ of $U$ by
\begin{align*}
F(P,b^2,b^2)
= \left( \int_{A_1} Θ^1, \dots, \int_{A_g} Θ^1, \right.& \int_{B_1} Θ^1, \dots, \int_{B_g} Θ^1, \int_{A_1} Θ^2, \dots, \int_{A_g} Θ^2, \int_{B_1} Θ^2, \dots, \int_{B_g} Θ^2, \\
&\left. \int_{γ_+} Θ^1, \int_{γ_-} Θ^1, \int_{γ_+} Θ^2, \int_{γ_-} Θ^2,\, P_1b^1_0 - 2P_0b^1_1,\, P_1b^2_0 - 2P_0b^2_1,\, P_0 - \prod_{i}(-α_i) \right)
\end{align*}
where $A_i, B_i$ are the real and imaginary periods of the curve $η^2 = P(ζ)$, $γ_+,γ_-$ are the paths in the curve between the points of $ζ=1$ and $ζ=-1$, and $α_i$ are the roots of $P$ inside the unit circle. The choice of a small subset $V$ ensures that the choice of paths may be made smoothly and consistently. If these periods satisfy $ $The differential of $F$ is a map from $\R^{4g+11}$ to $\R^{4g+9} = \R^{4g+4+2+2+1}$. A point of $\mathcal{M}$ where $\gcd(P,b^1,b^2) = 1$ falls into one of the above three cases. In each case we computed that the kernel of $dF$ is two dimensional. Therefore at every such point, by the implict function theorem, $\mathcal{M}$ is a manifold.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

To close this chapter, let us give a geometric interpretation to the polynomial $Q$. Recall that the conformal type of the domain of a harmonic map is given by the ratios of the principal parts of the differentials. Let the conformal type be denoted $τ$. For a nonconformal harmonic map we have that $b^2_0 = τ b^1_0$. Considering the constant terms of \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} we have that
\[
\dot{P}_0b^i_0 -2P_0 \dot{b}^i = 2P_0\hat{c}^i_0.
\]
Noting that $c^i_0 = - \hat{c}^i_0$, we substitute this into \eqref{eqn:Q} to arrive at
\[
Q_0 P_0 = b^1_0 c^2_0 - b^2_0 c^1_0 = b^1_0 \dot{b}^2_0 - \dot{b}^1_0 b^2_0.
\]
Differentiating the relationship $b^2_0 = τ b^1_0$ gives $\dot{b}^2_0 = \dot{τ} b^1_0 + τ \dot{b}^1_0$. Using this yields that
\[
Q_0 = \frac{\dot{τ}}{τ} \frac{b^1_0 b^2_0}{P_0}.
\]
We see therefore that $Q_0$ controls the change in the conformal type.
