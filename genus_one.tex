The different moduli spaces we could be interested in

There are several interrelated moduli spaces of spectral data that we could be interested in. Spectral data is a triple $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$ of a spectral curve $Σ$ and a pair of differentials on it. We know that every spectral curve has many differentials with with correct poles and symmetries. Spectral curves are parameterised by their branch points, and by symmetries we need only track branch points inside the unit circle. By counting degrees, we know there is a plane of such differentials with purely imaginary periods, but in general not every spectral curve will satisfy the further condition that there is a rank two lattice of differentials within this plane that have integral periods. Let the space of spectral curves that have \emph{integral} differentials be denoted $\mathcal{C}$. Within this space we could impose the further condition, the closing condition, on the differentials that requires their integrals over the marked points to also be integral. We shall call such differentials \emph{closing}, and the space of spectral curves with closing differentials $\mathcal{S}$.

One can note that the plane of differentials with imaginary periods is naturally thought of as a rank two vector bundle over the space of spectral curves. Thus the moduli of closing spectral data $\mathcal{M}$ can be thought of a bundle over $\mathcal{S}$. Our ultimate aim will be to describe this bundle.

If we are considering only spectral curves of a fixed genus, we will use a subscript on the moduli space to denote this. In this chapter we are considering only genus one, so we will omit subscripts.

In the genus one case, every spectral curve admits integral differentials but not every one admits closing differentials. The closing conditions therefore can be viewed as defining equations for $\mathcal{S}$ within $\mathcal{C}$. We will investigate the topology of this space and show it to be naturally divided into path connected components that are dense in $\mathcal{C}$. Most components will be simply connected, except for an exceptional family of annuli. In the course of our investigation we will develop an explicit parameterisation of this space. The moduli space $\mathcal{M}$ will be show to be a trivial bundle.

In the calculations that follow, we will actually work with a cover of the space of spectral curves. A spectral curve is determined by its branch points, but we will consider instead ordered pairs of branch points. Let $\mathcal{A}$ be the space $\{ (α,β) \in D^2 \mid α \neq β \}$, where $D$ is the open unit disc. If we consider the action of $\Z_2$ that interchanges the two points, then we note that it is a free and transitive action. The quotient space is smooth, indeed it can be identified with the space of spectral curves $\mathcal{C}$. We consider $\mathcal{A}$ as a two-to-one cover of $\mathcal{C}$. We will work primarily with the former, which we may consider as the space of spectral curves with a distinguished branch point $α$.

\subsection{Differentials of the Elliptic Spectral Curve}
It will be necessary to have explicit formulae for the integral differentials of the spectral curve. To compute the periods of differentials, we must first reduce them into a standard form. Every differential of the second kind, that is, those that have double poles with no residues, may be written as the sum of standard elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, and exact differentials. Towards this end, we will transform from the form of the spectral curve prefered by Hitchin to the Jacobi form of an elliptic curve, on which the standard elliptic integrals are defined. Consider the genus one spectral curve
\[
η^2 = P(ζ) = (ζ-α)(1-\bar{α}ζ)(ζ-β)(1-\bar{β}ζ)
\]
with roots $α, \cji{α}, β$ and $\cji{β}$, and the Jacobi normal form
\[
w^2 = (1-z^2)(1-k^2z^2)
\]
where $k$ is the elliptic modulus. There is a M\"obius transformation between the two, as we shall demonstrate. For a given spectral curve, how is one to compute the modulus and therefore determine the appropriate Jacobi form to transform into? Consider the cross ratio of the roots
\[
[α,\cji{α};β,\cji{β}] = \frac{\abs{α-β}^2}{\abs{1-\bar{α}β}^2} \labelthis{eqn:roots_cross_ratio}
\]
This is a real quantity, and so the four roots lie on a circle (or a line). Thus the roots of the Jacobi form do also, which forces $k$ to be real. Any transformation between the curves must take branch points to branch points, so we must decide on a correspondence for the roots. There are twenty-four possible orderings that can be divided into six groups of four, based on the value of the cross ratio. By convention, $k \in (0,1)$, which eliminates four of the groups. Of the two groups that remain we choose a representative: either $(α,\cji{α},β,\cji{β}) \mapsto (1,-1,k^{-1},-k^{-1})$ or $(1,k^{-1},-1,-k^{-1})$. A M\"obius transformation preserves the cross ratio, so we observe that
\begin{align}
[1,-1;k^{-1},-k^{-1}] &= \bra{\frac{k-1}{k+1}}^2, \label{eqn:good_ordering}\\
[1,k^{-1};-1,-k^{-1}] &= \frac{4k}{(k+1)^2}. \label{eqn:bad_ordering}
\end{align}
To choose between the two, consider the degenerations of the curve where two pairs of roots come together, that is $α=β$ (and $\cji{α} = \cji{β}$). In the Jacobi form, this manifests as the extreme $k=1$. \ref{eqn:roots_cross_ratio} takes the value zero, as does \ref{eqn:good_ordering}, but \ref{eqn:bad_ordering} takes the value one. Thus the latter is eliminated from contention. Only one group remains, and the modulus is given by
\[
k = \frac{\abs{1-\bar{α}β}-\abs{α-β}}{\abs{1-\bar{α}β}+\abs{α-β}}.
\labelthis{eqn:def_k}
\]

Within this group of orderings, four possibilities still remain
\[
  \begin{array}{ l|l|l|l}
    1 & -1 & k^{-1} & -k^{-1} \\
    \hline\hline
    α & \cji{α} & β & \cji{β} \\
    \cji{α} & α & \cji{β} & β \\
    β & \cji{β} & α & \cji{α} \\
    \cji{β} & β & \cji{α} & α \\
  \end{array}
\]
The first two rows and the last two rows exchanged by swapping the labelling of $α$ and $β$. We shall choose to send $α$ to a fixed root of the Jacobi form. Secondly, the first two rows send the points inside the unit circle to either the left or right half $z$-plane. We shall choose to send them to the right half plane.

Having fixed a mapping of the roots, namely $(α,\cji{α},β,\cji{β}) \mapsto (1,-1,k^{-1},-k^{-1})$, the formula for the transformation can be found by rearranging the relation $[ζ,β;α,\cji{α}] = [f(ζ),k^{-1};1,-1]$ to get
\begin{align}
A &:= (α-β)\abs{1-\bar{α}β}, \label{eqn:A} \\
B &:= (1-\bar{α}β)\abs{α-β}, \label{eqn:B} \\
z = f(ζ) &= \frac{ζ(\bar{α}A + B) - (A + αB)}{ζ(\bar{α}A - B) - (A - αB)}, \\
ζ = f^{-1}(z) &= \frac{-z(A-αB) + (A+αB)}{-z(\bar{α}A-B) + (\bar{α}A+B)}.
% den &:= ζ(\bar{α}A-B) - (A - αB)\\
% ned &:= -z(\bar{α}A-B) + (\bar{α}A+B)
\end{align}

Because of the holomorphic involution $η\to-η$, this formula almost but not quite specifies a relation between $η$ and $w$. There is a free sign choice to make. In $(ζ,η)$ there is a notion of the `upper' unit circle, the one on which $η$ is positive over $ζ=1$. More generally, on this copy of the unit circle in $Σ$, $η(ζ)=ζ\abs{ζ-α}\abs{ζ-β}$. Under the transformation the unit circle is mapped to the imaginary axis. On the imaginary axis, $w(iu) = \pm \sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+k^2u^2}$ so also has a notion of an upper sheet. We choose the transformation between elliptic curves to map the upper sheet to the upper sheet.
% The sign choice needed to make the upper unit circle map to the upper imaginary axis is
% \[
% η = \frac{AB\bra{1-\abs{α}^2}\bra{\abs{α-β}+ \abs{1-\bar{α}β}}}{(\bar{α}A-B)^2(z+\bar{z_0})^2}w
% \]

The unit circle in the $ζ$-plane plays an important role in the definition of a spectral curve, so it is natural to ask what its imagine under this transformation is.
The real involution $ρ(ζ)$ fixes the unit circle, and exchanges the pairs of branch points $α,\cji{α}$ and $β,\cji{β}$. The corresponding antiholomorphic involution in the $z$-plane is $z\mapsto -\bar{z}$. Its fixed point set is the imaginary axis, which therefore is the image of the unit circle.

As already mentioned, the four roots of the spectral curve are concyclic (or lie on a line), which we shall call the branch point circle. The intersection of this circle with the unit circle correspond to the points $z=0$ and $z=\infty$, which are the intersections of the real and imaginary axes. $z=0$ lies between $α$ and $\cji{α}$ and similiarly $z=\infty$ lies between $β$ and $\cji{β}$. We denote these points $μ = f^{-1}(0)$ and $ν = f^{-1}(\infty)$. Likewise we write $z_0 = f(0)$ and $-\bar{z_0} = f(\infty)$ (using the reality structure). These allow us to write alternate formula for $f$ and $f^{-1}$
\begin{align}
z = f(ζ) &= \frac{\bar{α}A + B}{\bar{α}A - B}\frac{ζ - μ}{ζ - ν}, \\
ζ = f^{-1}(z) &= \frac{A-αB}{\bar{α}A-B}\frac{z - z_0}{z + \bar{z_0}}.
\label{eqn:f_inv_2}
\end{align}

PICUTRE \todo{this}

Having set-up the transformation, we construct the desired differentials in two stages. First, we narrow the space to a 3 dimensional one, of differentials with the correct poles and symmetries. Then we compute the periods of the basis of the space. This allows us to find the differentials inside that space with the integral periods.

If we write differentials in the form
\[
b(ζ)\frac{dζ}{ζ^2η},
\]
for some polynomial $b(ζ)$, the restriction that the differentials have double poles at $ζ=0,\infty$ means that the polynomial part must be degree four. The restiction that these poles have no residues means that the bottom and top terms determine the first and third order terms. And finally the reality condition $ρ^* Θ = -\bar{Θ}$ means that the middle term must be real and the top term is the conjugate of the bottom term. In effect, we only have a complex number of choice in the bottom term and a real scalar in the middle term. This is our real 3-space of differentials.

First note that the holomorphic differential
\[
ω := \frac{dz}{w}
\]
lies in this space. It makes for an obvious first basis vector. It spans the middle terms completely.
In genus one, there is an exact differential with the correct pole behaviour, namely
\[
Θ^1 := \iu\; d\left( \frac{η}{ζ} \right)
% = \iu\left[ -αβ + \frac{1}{2}\left(α(1+\abs{β}^2) + β(1+\abs{α}^2)\right)ζ - \frac{1}{2}\left(\bar{α}(1+\abs{β}^2) + β(1+\abs{α}^2)\right)ζ^3 + \bar{α}\bar{β}ζ^4 \right]\frac{dζ}{ζ^2η}.
\]
It is real, curtesy of the factor $\iu$, and so it we take it as the second basis vector. As has been mentioned, every differential can be written as the sum of an exact differential, one of the first kind and one of the second kind. Given that we already have taken the standard differential of the first kind as a basis vector, we seek to complete the basis with the sum of the standard differential of the second kind and an exact differential.

The standard differential of the second kind is defined to be
\[
e := (1-k^2 z^2) \frac{dz}{w}.
\]
It is real, but it has a pole at $z=\infty$ ($ζ=ν$), which not allowed. This pole can be moved to $ζ=\infty$ by adding an exact differential.
\[
e + d\left[ \frac{w}{z + \bar{z}_0} \right].
\]
We verify now that the pole at $z=\infty$ has actually been cancelled. Letting $z' = z^{-1}$, at infinity $e$ has the expansion
\begin{align*}
w &\sim kz'^{-2} \bra{1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1+k^2}{k^2} z'^2 + \dots} \\
e &\sim kz'^{-2} dz' \bra{1-k^{-2}z'^2}\bra{1 + \frac{1+k^2}{k^2} z'^2 + \ldots}
\end{align*}
whereas the exact differential has
\begin{align*}
d\left[ \frac{w}{z + \bar{z}_0} \right]
&\sim d\left[ k z'^{-1} \bra{1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1+k^2}{k^2} z'^2 + \dots} \bra{1 - \bar{z}_0z' + \bar{z}_0^2z'^2  + \ldots} \right]\\
&= -k z'^{-2}dz' \bra{1 + \bra{\bar{z}_0^2 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{1+k^2}{k^2}}z'^2 + \ldots}
\end{align*}
which shows that it does cancel the double pole of $e$. Unfortunately, this exact differential does not have the correct symmetries. The space of exact differentials with the correct poles is spanned by
\[
d\left[ \frac{w}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)} \right],
\]
so we add a differential of this form to restore the symmetry.
\[
d\left[ \frac{w}{z + \bar{z}_0} + C\frac{w}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)}\right]
= d\left[ \frac{w(z - z_0 + C)}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)}\right]
\]
is real when $z_0 - C$ is an imaginary number. Thus $C \in \Re z_0 + i\R$. This degree of freedom to choose any imaginary amount is exactly adding a scalar of $Θ^1$. There are two obvious choices; taking $z_0 - C$ to be zero, or taking $C$ to be purely real. Both are valid, but the latter choice ends up being superior as it makes the principal part perpendicular to the principal part of $Θ^1$, which introduces a symmetry into the formulae that we will use later. Hence we take as our third basis differential
\[
λ := e + d\left[ \frac{w}{z + \bar{z}_0} \right] + \Re z_0 d\left[ \frac{w}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)} \right]
= e + d\left[ \frac{w(z - \iu\,\Im z_0)}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)} \right],
\]
which has both the correct poles and the correct symmetries.

We are now in a position to compute the periods of our basis. In the $ζ$-plane, let $γ_R, γ_I$ denote the real and imaginary periods respectively. We will choose the basis in the following way. For $γ_R$, start on the upper unit circle at $μ$, traverse in and around $α$ anticlockwise, then cross the lower unit circle and continue anticlockwise around $\cji{α}$ before returning to the starting point. For $γ_I$, start at the same point we began $γ_R$ and follow the unit circle clockwise. The image of $γ_R$ under $f$ is the anticlockwise loop around $-1$ and $1$ with the left to right part of the path on the upper sheet. $f(γ_I)$ is simply a traversal of the imaginary axis from bottom to on the upper sheet. But this is homologous to the standard clockwise loop around $1$ and $k^{-1}$.

\makefigure{$γ_R$ in red and $γ_I$ in black}{thesis_graphics_temp/zeta_periods.png}

To summarise the standard elliptic integrals
\begin{align*}
\int_{f(γ_R)} ω &= 4K(k) \\
\int_{f(γ_I)} ω &= 2\iu K' \\
\int_{f(γ_R)} e &= 4E(k) \\
\int_{f(γ_I)} e &= 2\iu(K'-E')
\end{align*}
where $K$ and $E$ are the complete elliptic integrals of the first and second kind, and the prime denote not the derivative but instead the complement. By definition $k' = \sqrt{1-k^2}$ and $K'(k) = K(k')$ and ditto for $E'$. Let $Θ^2 = Ωω + Λλ$ and we wish for this differential to have a real period of zero and an imaginary period of $2π\iu$. That requires
\begin{align*}
4KΩ + 4EΛ &= 0 \\
2\iu K' Ω + 2\iu(K'-E')Λ &= 2π\iu
\end{align*}
From the first equation, we can write $Λ = - ΓK$ and $Ω = ΓE$ for some $Γ$. Substituting this into the second equation gives
\begin{align*}
π
&= K'ΓE - (K'-E')ΓK \\
&= Γ(K'E + KE' - KK') \labelthis{eqn:legendre_relation}\\
&= \frac{\pi}{2}Γ \\
Γ &= 2
\end{align*}
where \eqref{eqn:legendre_relation} uses Legendre's relation. Thus $Θ^2 = 2Eω - 2Kλ$, or if we unwind these definitions a little
\[
Θ^2 = 2E ω - 2Ke - 2K d\left[ \frac{w(z-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)} \right]
\]
which shows a nice division, with the first two terms providing the desired periods and the last two terms giving the required pole behaviour. With this differential found, every integral differential is of the form $a Θ^1 + n Θ^2$ for some $a\in\R$ and $n\in\Z$.


EXPAND ON THIS: \todo{this}
These differentials do not vanish for any $(α,β) \in \mathcal{A}$, and so trivialise the $\Z\times\R$-bundle $\mathcal{B}$ over $\mathcal{A}$.

\todo{} These differenitals are also invariant under the involution that swaps the branch points, so they also serve as a basis for the differentials over $\mathcal{C}$








\subsection{The Closing Conditions}
Recall the closing conditions. These are the conditions that spectral data must meet in order that they correspond to a harmonic map from the torus, rather than a harmonic map of the plane (of finite type). If $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$ is a triple of spectral data, $Θ$ satisfies the closing condition at $ζ=1$ if
\[
\int_{γ_{+}} Θ \in 2π\iu \Z,
\]
where $γ_+$ is a path that begins at $(1,η(1)^-)$ and ends at $(1,η(1)^+)$, the two points on the spectral curve lying over $ζ=1$. However, the value of the integral is dependent on the particular path chosen. To see that this condition is well defined, suppose that $γ$ and $γ'$ are two paths between the two points over $ζ=1$. Their difference $γ-γ'$ is a closed loop and homologous to an integral combination of periods $aγ_R + bγ_I$. The difference in the values of the integrals is therefore
\[
\int_{γ} Θ - \int_{γ'} Θ
= \int_{γ - γ'} Θ
= a\int_{γ_R} Θ + b\int_{γ_I} Θ
= 2π\iu nb,
\]
because by the period conditions, the real period of $Θ$ is zero and its imaginary period is a multiple of $2π\iu$. So although the value of the integral is dependent on the path, the condition that the value must lie in $2π\iu \Z$ is not. Likewise, the closing condition at $ζ=-1$ is defined by taking $γ_-$, a path from $(-1,η(-1)^-)$ to $(-1,η(-1)^+)$, and requiring the integral of $Θ$ over this path to lie in $2π\iu \Z$ also.

For an exact differential, the particular path of integration is irrelevant and the value of the integral is well defined.
\[
\int_{γ_{+}} Θ^1 = i \left. d\bra{\frac{η}{ζ}} \right|_{(1, η(1)^-)}^{(1, η(1)^+)} = 2i η(1)^+ = 2i \abs{1-α}\abs{1-β}
\]
And similiarly for the other marked point
\[
\int_{γ_{-}} Θ^1 = -2i η(-1)^+ = 2i \abs{1+α}\abs{1+β}.
\]
One can use these formulae to define an explicit condition for a spectral curve to admit an exact closing differential. An exact closing differential must be a real multiple of $Θ^1$. Let the scaling factor be $a$. The two closing conditions applied to $a Θ^1$ are then
\begin{align*}
2\iu η(1)^+ a &\in 2π\iu \Z, \\
-2\iu η(-1)^- a &\in 2π\iu \Z.
\end{align*}
Eliminating $a$ from the two equations, there is a common solution for $a$ if and only if
\[
p := \frac{2\iu η(1)^+}{-2\iu η(-1)^-} = \frac{\abs{1-α}\abs{1-β}}{\abs{1+α}\abs{1+β}} \in \Q^+.
\labelthis{eqn:def_p}
\]
In other words, if and only if $p(α,β)$ is a positive rational. This gives the flavour of what we are aiming to achieve. We would like to give conditions on a spectral curve that ensures it admits closing spectral data, and we would like to give such conditions explicitly so we can give results on the subspace of such spectral curves within the space of all spectral curves.

Before we plow ahead to differentials with periods, there is a simplification we can make. Suppose that a spectral curve admits a pair of closing differentials $Θ,\tilde{Θ}$ with periods $2π\iu n, 2π\iu \tilde{n}$ respectively. Let $g$ be the greatest common denominator of $n$ and $\tilde{n}$ (choosen to be a positive number), and by Bezout's identity let $x,y$ be the integers that satisfy
\[
xn + y\tilde{n} = g.
\]
Then consider the differentials $Ψ,\tilde{Ψ}$ defined by the following integer combination
\[
\vt{Ψ}{\tilde{Ψ}} =
\begin{pmatrix}
\tfrac{\tilde{n}}{g}    &   -\tfrac{\tilde{n}}{g} \\
x                       &   y
\end{pmatrix}
\vt{Θ}{\tilde{Θ}}
\]
The new pair of differentials are simpler in the sense that their imaginary periods are $0$ and $2π\iu g$ respectively. They are also closing, because they are an integer combination of closing differentials. And the integer matrix has determinant one, so is invertible over the integers. Further, the two differentials are linearly dependent exactly when $Ψ$ is zero. Hence,
\begin{lem}
A curve admits linearly independent closing differentials if and only if it admits nonzero closing differentials with imaginary periods $0$ and $2π\iu g$, for some positive integer $g$.
\end{lem}

Thus the condition above, $p\in\Q^+$, is a necessary conditon for a spectral curve to admit closing differentials. To find a second necessary condition, concerning the differential with period $2π\iu g$, we follow the same line of reasoning. For some real number $b$, we may write $\tilde{Ψ} = b Θ^1 + g Θ^2$. Fix two paths $γ_+, γ_-$. The two closing conditions applied to $\tilde{Ψ}$ are then
\begin{align*}
2η(1)^+ \iu b + g\int_{γ_+} Θ^2 &= 2π\iu Γ^+ \in 2π\iu \Z, \\
-2η(-1)^+ \iu b + g\int_{γ_-} Θ^2 &= 2π\iu Γ^- \in 2π\iu \Z.
\end{align*}
Again, elimination of $b$ yields the condition for a common solution to exist. This equation can be written as
\[
2π\iu T := p \int_{γ_-} Θ^2 - \int_{γ_+} Θ^2 = 2π \iu \frac{p Γ^- - Γ^+}{g}.
\labelthis{eqn:def_T}
\]

\begin{lem}
\label{lem:closing_conds}
A spectral curve admits a pair of nonzero closing differentials, one exact and one inexact, if and only if $p\in\Q^+$ and $T\in\Q$ for any paths $γ_+, γ_-$.

\begin{proof}
From the above discussion, these are a necessary conditions.

For the converse suppose that the are both rational, say $p = n/m$ and $T = n'/m'$. The rationality of $p$ ensures the consistent solution of an $a$, and hence the existence of $Ψ = aΘ^1$ satisfying the closing conditions. Explicitly
\[
a = \frac{2π\iu n}{2\iu η(1)^+} = \frac{2π\iu n}{-2\iu η(-1)^+}\frac{-2\iu η(-1)^+}{2\iu η(1)^+} = \frac{2π\iu n}{-2\iu η(-1)^+} \frac{1}{p} = \frac{2π\iu m}{-2\iu η(-1)^+}.
\]

To find a $\tilde{Ψ}$, we must first solve
\[
T = \frac{n'}{m'} = \frac{n'm}{m'm} = \frac{n Γ^- - mΓ^+}{gm}.
\]
We can see that we may take $g$ to be $m'$. Let $x,y$ be integers such that $xm-ny = 1$. Then we may take
\[
Γ^+ = n'mx,\;\; Γ^- = n'my,
\]
to obtain equality of the numerator. Hence the condition for the existence of a consistent solution for $b$ is met. $b$ may be computed as
\[
b = \frac{1}{2\iu η(1)^+}\bra{ 2π\iu y n'm - m' \int_{γ_+} Θ^2 }.
\]
In summary, we have found $a,b$ and $g$ such that $Ψ = aΘ^1, \tilde{Ψ} = bΘ^1 + gΘ^2$ solve the closing conditions, and so we have demonstrated that the spectral curve admits closing differentials.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

Thus the space of genus one spectral curves that admit closing spectral data is defined by the equations $p(α,β) \in \Q^+, T(α,β) \in \Q$ inside $\mathcal{A}$. In general the closing conditions are difficult to work with, harder than even the period conditions. In the genus one case that we are dealing with the integrals of $Θ^1$ lead to an algebraic expression, as we have just seen, but the integrals of $Θ^2$ will lead to a transcendental conditions involving incomplete elliptic integrals.

Note that although the condition $T\in\Q$ is well defined, $T$ is a multivalued function on $\mathcal{A}$. It it dependent on the paths of integration. As previously seen, different paths will change the integrals by multiples of $2π\iu$ and therefore $T$ is defined up to an element of $\Z\langle 1,p\rangle \subset \Q$. In practice, we will make some branch cuts on $\mathcal{A}$ and choose a principal branch of $T$.

Let us then make a principal choice of paths, and let the value of $T$ on these principal choices be denoted $T_0$. Consider the open dense subset $\mathcal{A}_0$ of $\mathcal{A}$ where $ν \neq \pm 1$. On any spectral curve of $\mathcal{A}_0$, let $γ_+$ be the path that begins at $(1,-η(1))$, traverses the unit circle to the point $μ$ without crossing $ν$, follows the branch point circle to $α$, circles this branch point anticlockwise, goes back along the arc (though on a different sheet now) to the unit circle, and back to $(1,+η(1))$. Likewise for $γ_-$ from $(-1,-η(-1))$ to $(-1,η(-1))$. In the case $ν=\pm 1$, it would be impossible to `avoid' $ν$, so this case had to be excluded.

PICTURE \todo{picture}

In $(z,w)$ coordinates these paths are easy to describe by design. Start from the point $f(1)$ on the imaginary axis and go to the origin. Go out along the real axis, around $z=1$ (which corresponds to $ζ=α$) and back again to the origin. Return along the imaginary axis to $f(1)$. By taking the path that avoids $ν$, which corresponds to $z=\infty$, we keep to the realm of path integrals in the plane.

PICTURE \todo{picture}

We can derive explicit formula for the value of the integrals on these particular paths.
\begin{align*}
\int_{γ_+} \tilde {ω}
&= \bra{2\int_0^{f(1)} - 2\int_0^1} \tilde {ω} \\
&= 2 F(f(1);k) - 2 K(k) \\
\int_{γ_+} e
&= 2 \tilde E(f(1);k) - 2 E(k) \\
\int_{γ_+} Θ^2
&= \int_{γ_+} (2Eω - 2Ke) - 2K \int_{γ_+} d\left[ \frac{w(z-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(z-z_0)(z + \bar{z}_0)} \right] \\
&= 4 E(k) F(f(1);k) - 4 K(k) E(f(1);k) - 4K \frac{w(f(1))\,(f(1)-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(f(1)-z_0)(f(1) + \bar{z}_0)}.\labelthis{eqn:gamma_plus}
\end{align*}

For the closing condition at $ζ=-1$
\begin{align*}
\int_{γ_-} Θ^2
&= 4 E(k) F(f(-1);k) - 4 K(k) E(f(-1);k) - 4K \frac{w(f(-1))\,(f(-1)-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(f(-1)-z_0)(f(-1) + \bar{z}_0)}.\labelthis{eqn:gamma_minus}
\end{align*}

If one wishes, one could substitute these formulae into \ref{eqn:def_T} to get $T_0$. Previously, the comment was made that the particular algorithm to chose a path is not valid when $ν = \pm 1$. Indeed, the result of this can be seen directly in the formulae we have derived. When $ν$ takes either of these values, then one of $f(1)$ or $f(-1)$ will be inifinite. $T_0$ is a real valued function because $f(1)$ and $f(-1)$ are purely imaginary, $F(z;k)$ and $E(z;k)$ take the imaginary axis to itself and,
\[
(f(1)-z_0)(f(1) + \bar{z}_0) = -(f(1)-z_0)(\overline{f(1) - z_0}) = - \abs{f(1) - z_0}^2.
\]

% Properly understood, $T$ is not a function on the space of spectral curves $\mathcal{A}$, but rather it is a function on the space of paths $(γ_+, γ_-)$, which we shall call $\mathcal{P}$. To be more precise, let $\mathcal{P}$ be the space $\{(γ_+, γ_-, Σ, α)\}$ where $α$ is one of the branch points inside the unit circle of some genus one spectral curve $Σ$ and $γ_+$ and $γ_-$ are paths $(0,1) \to Σ$ defined in the following way. $γ_+$ starts at $(1, η(1)^-)$, monotonically tranverses the unit circle to $μ$ (that is, it does not pause or reverse direction), goes along the branch point circle to $α$, encircles it, returns to $μ$ along the branch point circle and retraces its path to $(1, η(1)^+)$. In an analogous way, $γ_-$ starts at $(-1, η(-1)^-)$ and finishes at $(-1, η(-1)^+)$. We shall call such paths rigid. Every path on $Σ$ that connects the two points over $1$ or $-1$ is homologous to one of these rigid paths.
%
% $\mathcal{P}$ is naturally a $\Z^2$-bundle over the space $\mathcal{A}$. The projection map takes a tuple $(γ_+, γ_-, Σ, α)$ to the underlying spectral curve $(Σ,α)$. The fibre over any spectral curve $Σ$ is seen to be $\Z^2$, because if one fixes a point on the upper unit circle, not lying over $1,-1,μ$, the (signed) number of crossings of that point by a path uniquely determines that path. As an aside, the issue with points over $1,-1$ and $μ$ is that the paths may terminate there (in the obvious way for the first two, in the sense that the path may leave the unit circle in the latter case). One could probably introduce a convention to get around this, but it is not necessary to do so for our purposes.
%
% Viewed from this perspective, we consider $T$ to be a multivalued function on $\mathcal{A}$ defined locally up the addition of multiples of $p$ and $1$, and $T_0$ is a principal branch cut. We call $\tilde{T}$ the well defined version that is defined on $\mathcal{P}$. $\mathcal{P}$ is actually a cover of the universal cover of $\mathcal{A}$ (implying $\mathcal{P}$ is disconnected), a fact that will become apparent once we have adopted coordinates better adapted to the situation.







\subsection{Marked Point Coordinates}
\label{sub:Reformulate}

It is our ultimate aim to examine the surfaces defined by the two conditions and our examination will result in coordinates for those surfaces. This involves applying the implicit function theorem and the necessary computation for that theorem requires differentiating the above expressions. It is therefore prudent to adopt a parameterisation of the space of spectral curves more suited to that task than $(α,β)$. An obvious first coordinate is $p$ itself, as then we can enforce the first condition simply by holding this coordinate constant. Elliptic integrals are the most difficult part of the above to differentiate, so to minimise our labour we choose the other three (real) coordinates to be $k$, $\iu u = f(1)$ and $\iu v = f(-1)$.

\begin{defn}\label{def:parameter space}
Consider the product space $\R_{>0} \times (0,1) \times (\RInf) \times (\RInf)$. Let $p \in \R_{>0}$ and $k \in (0,1)$ be coordinates on the first two factors. Let $u, u' \in \R$, with $u' = u^{-1}$, be coordinates covering the third factor in the standard way, and likewise let $v, v' \in\R$, with $v' = v^{-1}$ be coordinates covering the fourth factor. Together, the four coordinate patches $(p,k,u,v)$, $(p,k,u',v)$, $(p,k,u,v')$ and $(p,k,u',v')$ to $\R_{>0} \times (0,1) \times \R^2$ cover $\R_{>0} \times (0,1) \times (\RInf)^2$.

Consider the hypersurface $H$ that is the closure of $\{u=v\}$. In each of the four coordinate patches it is given by the equations $u-v = 1-u'v = uv'- 1 = v' - u' = 0$. Define $\mathcal{A}'$ to be the complement of $H$.
\end{defn}

Note that $\mathcal{A}'$ does not include the points where $u'=v'=0$, so it is covered by three of the coordinate patches; $(p,k,u,v)$, $(p,k,u',v)$ and $(p,k,u,v')$ are sufficent for example.

First we must show that $\mathcal{A}'$ does indeed parameterise the space of spectral curves. We proceed by determining a formula for the change of parameters from $(α,β)$ to $(p,k,u,v)$. The forward direction has already been achived. The map $f$ is written in terms of $(α,β)$ \todo{ref} and the new parameters $\iu u$ and $\iu v$ are the images of points $1$ and $-1$ respectively under this map, and both $p$ and $k$ already have their own formulae in terms of $α$ and $β$ (\ref{eqn:def_p}, \ref{eqn:def_k} respectively).

As the old parameters $α,β$ are points in the $ζ$-plane, one method to derive the reverse change in parameters is to express the inverse transformation $f^{-1}(z)$ in term of our new parameters. Then $α = f^{-1}(1)$ and $β = f^{-1}(k^{-1})$, entirely analogous to to forward direction. Recall $z_0 = f(0)$, the image of $ζ=0$ in the $z$-plane. The real structure of the $z$-plane then forces $f(\infty) = - \conj{z_0}$. As a M\"obius transformation is described up to a scalar by the points sent to $0$ and $\infty$, $f^{-1}$ is a scalar multiple of
\[
\frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}},
\]
(compare to \ref{eqn:f_inv_2}). Note the following trick using cross ratios.
\[
\abs{\frac{α-1}{α+1}}
= \abs{\frac{α-1}{α+1}} \abs{\frac{0+1}{0-1}}
= \abs{ \cross{α}{0}{1}{-1} }
= \abs{ \cross{1}{z_0}{\iu u}{\iu v} }
= \abs{\frac{1-\iu u}{1 - \iu v}} \abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}}
\]
The same trick gives a similar formula for $β$.
\[
\abs{\frac{β-1}{β+1}}
= \abs{\frac{1-k\iu u}{1 - k\iu v}} \abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}}
\]
The terms on the left are the two halves of the expression for $p$. Multiplying and expanding shows that for fixed values of the parameters $(p,k,u,v)$, $z_0$ lies on a particular circle. Let $z_0 = x+\iu y$.
\begin{align*}
p
&= \abs{\frac{α-1}{α+1}} \abs{\frac{β-1}{β+1}}
= \abs{\frac{1-\iu u}{1 - \iu v}}\abs{\frac{1 - k\iu u}{1 - k\iu v}} \abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}}^2 \\
\abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}} ^2
&= p \frac{\sqrt{1+v^2}}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}\frac{\sqrt{1+k^2v^2}}{\sqrt{1+k^2u^2}}
= p \frac{w(\iu v)}{w(\iu u)} \\
\abs{z_0 - \iu v} ^2 &= p \frac{w(\iu v)}{w(\iu u)} \abs{z_0 - \iu u}^2 \\
x^2 + y^2 &+ 2y \frac{puw(\iu v) - vw(\iu u)}{w(\iu u)-pw(\iu v)} + \frac{v^2w(\iu u) - pu^2w(\iu v)}{w(\iu u)-pw(\iu v)} = 0.
\end{align*}

In the $ζ$-plane, the points $-1,0,1$ all lie on a straight line that is perpendicular to the unit circle at both $-1$ and $1$, and invariant under the real involution. Applying the M\"obius transformation $f$ we can therefore say that $\iu v, z_0$ and $\iu u$ all lie on a circle that is perpendicular to the imaginary axis and symmetric under reflection in the imaginary axis. Then $z_0$ lies on the circle
\[
x^2 + \bra{ y - \frac{u+v}{2} }^2 = \frac{(u-v)^2}{4},
\]
which simplifies to the relation
\[
x^2 + y^2 = y(u+v) - uv.
\]
These two circles intersect in two points: $z_0$ and $-\conj{z_0}$. The precise formulas are
\[
x = \frac{\sqrt{pw(\iu u)w(\iu v)}}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)} \abs{u-v},\; y = \frac{puw(\iu v) + vw(\iu u)}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}
\]
where the sign of $x$ is chosen to make $z_0$ lie in the right half of the $z$-plane. This choice amounts to choosing the branch points $α,β$ inside the unit circle, as opposed to choicing their conjugate-inverse partners. Having found $z_0$ in terms of $(p,k,u,v)$ it remains to find the correct scaling of $f^{-1}$. We use the fact that $f^{-1}(\iu u) = 1$.
\begin{align*}
% f^{-1}(z) &= C \frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}} \\
% 1 = f^{-1}(\iu u) &= C \frac{\iu u - z_0}{\iu u + \conj{z_0}} \\
f^{-1}(z) &=  \frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0} \frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}}
\end{align*}
As was previously presented, one can simply take $α = f^{-1}(1)$ and $β = f^{-1}(k^{-1})$ to give formula for the branch points in terms of the new parameters.

In the case that one of $f(1)$ or $f(-1)$ is infinite, one needs to transistion to the coordinates $u'$ or $v'$ to maintain valid formulae. Though standard, it is perhaps still of some interest to consider the above geometrical argument in this limit. Suppose that $u' = 0$, which is to say geometrically that $1$ is mapped to infinity by $f$. Then the transformation $f$ takes the line through $1,0,-1$ to a line perpendicular to the imaginary axis, cutting at $f(-1)$. This line is therefore horizontal and so $z_0$ and $\iu v$ have the same imaginary parts. This gives $y=v$ directly. Considering next $p$, the special case of the cross ratio gives that
\begin{align*}
p
&= \frac{\abs{z_0 -\iu v}^2}{\abs{1-\iu v}\abs{k^{-1}-\iu v}} \\
&= \frac{x^2}{k^{-1}\sqrt{1+v^2}\sqrt{1+k^2 v^2}} \\
x &= \sqrt{\frac{p w(\iu v)}{k}}.
\end{align*}
These are the same formulas for $x$ and $y$ that one arrives by substituting $u = (u')^{-1}$ in the previous formulas and taking a limit $u' \to 0$. Given this modification of $z_0$, the rest of the formula for $f^{-1}$ is as before. The geometry for $f(-1) = \infty$ is similar. We summarise this in the following lemma.

\begin{lem}
The following maps between $\mathcal{A} = \{ (α,β) \in D\times D | α \neq β \}$ and $\mathcal{A}'$ (def \ref{def:parameter space}) are diffeomorphisms. Recall $A, B$ (ref \todo{ref}), functions of $(α,β)$, and
\[
f(ζ) = \frac{ζ(\bar{α}A + B) - (A + αB)}{ζ(\bar{α}A - B) - (A - αB)}.
\]
Also recall from above $z_0$, a function of $(p,k,u,v)$ and
\[
f^{-1}(p,u,v,k)(z) =  \frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0} \frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}}.
\]
The maps
\begin{align}
φ :     & \mathcal{A} \to \mathcal{A}' \\
        & (α,β) \mapsto
\begin{cases}
(p(α,β), k(α,β), u'=0, v = \Im f(-1)),         &\text{if $f(1) = \infty$} \\
(p(α,β), k(α,β), u = \Im f(1), v' = 0),          &\text{if $f(-1) = \infty$} \\
(p(α,β), k(α,β), u = \Im f(1), v = \Im f(-1)),  &\text{otherwise} \\
\end{cases}
\end{align}
and
\begin{align}
φ'  &:\;\mathcal{A}' \to \mathcal{A} \\
    (p,k,u,v) &\mapsto \left( f^{-1}(u,v)(1), f^{-1}(u,v)(k^{-1}) \right) \\
    (p,k,u',v) &\mapsto \left( f^{-1}(u',v)(1), f^{-1}(u',v)(k^{-1}) \right) \\
    (p,k,u,v') &\mapsto \left( f^{-1}(u,v')(1), f^{-1}(u,v')(k^{-1}) \right),
\end{align}
are well-defined mutually inverse diffeomorphisms.

\begin{proof}
These maps are inverses by construction above. We have not checked if the formulae are well-defined everywhere. For $φ'$, such a problem could potentially occur if $z_0$ were to equal $\iu u$, in which case the scaling factor would be $0/0$. This could only occur if $\Re{z_0}=0$, which itself only occurs if $u=v$. But this is exactly the plane which is excluded from $\mathcal{A}'$.

In the forward direction, $p$ and $k$ are well behaved functions. The only complicating situation is when $f(1)$ or $f(-1)$ is infinite, but this is exactly when $u'$ or $v'$ is zero. The functions could only fail to be smooth if they contain an expression of the form $\abs{h}$ at a point where $h=0$. Looking through the defintions of the formulae, this occurs when one of the following is the zero:
\[
u-v,\;\;    pw(\iu u)w(\iu v),\;\;      α-β,\;\;    1- \conj{α}β.
\]
The first is excluded from $\mathcal{A}'$, the second is never zero, the third is also excluded from the domain, and the last is zero, if and only if $\cji{α} - β =0$ which is impossible if both $α,β$ are inside the unit circle.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}


Thus $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{A}'$ can be identified as spaces, and we will no longer use a prime to distinguish between them. Note when $ν=1$, $f(1) = \iu\infty$ and when $ν=-1$, $f(-1) = \iu\infty$, so the subset $\mathcal{A}_0$ is precisely covered by the coordinates $(p,k,u,v)$.  Having established formula for the inverse transformation from the new coordinates, it is time to rewrite $T_0$ in terms of $(p,k,u,v)$. Particularly, we must compute the factors in the elementary terms of the half-periods. By direct computation
\begin{align*}
u-y &= \frac{w(\iu u)(u-v)}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)} &
\abs{\iu u - z_0}^2 &= \frac{w(\iu u)(u-v)^2}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)} \\
v-y &= - \frac{w(\iu v)(u-v)}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)} &
\abs{\iu v - z_0}^2 &= \frac{w(\iu v)(u-v)^2}{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}
\end{align*}
These expressions combine to give from \ref{eqn:gamma_plus} and \ref{eqn:gamma_minus}
\begin{align*}
- 4K \frac{w(f(1))\,(f(1)-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(f(1)-z_0)(f(1) + \bar{z}_0)}
&= 4\iu K \frac{w(\iu u)\,(u-y)}{\abs{\iu u-z_0}^2}
= 4\iu K \frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v}, \\
- 4K \frac{w(f(-1))\,(f(-1)-\iu\,\Im z_0)}{(f(-1)-z_0)(f(-1) + \bar{z}_0)}
&= 4\iu K \frac{w(\iu v)\,(v-y)}{\abs{\iu v-z_0}^2}
= -4\iu K \frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v},
\end{align*}
and hence that
\begin{align*}
2π\iu T_0(p,k,u,v)
&= p\left\{ 4 E F(\iu v;k) - 4K E(\iu v;k) - 4 K \frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right\}
- \left\{ 4 E F(\iu u;k) - 4K E(\iu u;k) + 4 K \frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} \right\} \\
&= p \left[ E F(\iu v;k) - K E(\iu v;k) \right] - 4\left[ E F(\iu u;k) - K E(\iu u;k) \right] - 4\iu K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v}.
\labelthis{eqn:Teqn}
\end{align*}

Consider the parameter space $\mathcal{A}$ for a fixed value of $p$, denoted $\mathcal{A}(p)$. Topologically it is the product of an interval and an annulus, a feature not easily seen from the $α,β$ description. The interval component is obvious, it comes from $k\in (0,1)$. To see the annulus part, consider $\RInf \times \RInf$. Topologically $\RInf$ is just a circle, so this product is a torus. The line $u=v$ can be represented as the line where the toroidal and poloidal angles are equal, and removing this line leaves an annulus.

A more instructive way of visualising $\mathcal{A}$ is to think of it as a solid cylinder with a line along the central axis removed. One should think of the `radius' of point being given by $1-k$, so that the central axis is identified with the value $k=1$. To motivate this, consider formula \ref{eqn:def_k} for $k$.
\[
k = \frac{\abs{1-\bar{α}β}-\abs{α-β}}{\abs{1-\bar{α}β}+\abs{α-β}}.
\]
In the limit as $α \to β$, this formula says that $k \to 1$. From the equation of $p$, for a fixed value of $p$, the subspace $α=β$ is an arc. In this visualisation we are imagining this arc as the central axis of the cylinder. In later chapters, the interesting structure of the moduli space in this limit will be investigated.

% Another way that this model is useful is it allows us to see how the space of spectral curves is not simply connected and the essential appearence of the multivalued behaviour of $T$. Take a small loop around the central axis, which is to say a certain path in the space of spectral curves with $k$ close to $1$. This implies that $α$ and $β$ must be close together, and so the branch point circle is approximately a line. As we move around the axis, the points $μ,ν$ in the $ζ$-plane are moving around the unit circle. Every time $ν$ crosses either $1$ or $-1$, we have moved across a branch cut. After one full rotation, $α$ and $β$ have returned to their original positions, but $T$ has been incremented by $1+p$.

% PERIOD BEHAVIOR HASN"T BEEN INTRODUCED YET \todo{reorder this}

The fact that the parameter space is not simply connected and that $T$ is not even a single valued function could obstruct our use of the implicit function theorem. The obvious way to correct this is to move the the unversal cover.

\begin{defn}
The universal cover of $\mathcal{A}$ is
\[
\mathcal{\tilde{A}} =
\{(p, k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) \in \R^+\times(0,1)\times\R\times\R \mid  \tilde{u} < \tilde{v} < \tilde{u} + 2π \},
\]
with the projection map $\mathcal{\tilde{A}} \to \mathcal{A}$ is given by
\begin{align*}
    p &= p, \\
    k &= k, \\
    u &= \tan \frac{\tilde{u}}{2},
    \quad  u' = \cot \frac{\tilde{u}}{2}, \\
    v &= \tan \frac{\tilde{v}}{2},
    \quad  v' = \cot \frac{\tilde{v}}{2}.
\end{align*}
\end{defn}

The justification of this definition of $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$ precedes in two steps. First, the universal cover of $\R_{>0} \times (0,1) \times \RInf\times\RInf$ is $\R_{>0} \times (0,1) \times \R\times\R$, with the two circle components being covered by the line via a standard half-tan mapping as witnessed in the formulae above. The second step is to recall that $\mathcal{A}$ is the complement of the line $u-v = 0$. When pulled back to the universal cover, this becomes a collections of lines $u-v \in 2π\Z$. Only one stripe is needed to cover $\mathcal{A}$, and this is $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$ above.

It is straightforward to lift $T_0$ to a single valued function $\tilde{T}$ on $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$. Recall the defintions of $F_0$ and $E_0$ from Appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic Integrals}.
\[
F_0(x ;k) = \Im F(\iu x; k), \qquad
E_0(x ;k) = \Im F(\iu x; k) - kx.
\]
Using these, we rewrite $T_0$ in the follwoing way.
\[
2π T_0(p,k,u,v) =
4p \left[ E F_0(v) - K E_0(v) \right]
-4 \left[ E F_0(u) - K E_0(u) \right]
- 4 K \left[p\left\{\frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} + kv \right\} + \left\{\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - ku \right\} \right] .
\]

\begin{lem}
The function
\[
\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - ku
\]
is an analytic function on $\mathcal{A}$.

\begin{proof}
As $u-v \neq 0$ on $\mathcal{A}$, this is an anlytic function of these coordinates. It remains to show that it is simiarly analytic in the other coordinates required to cover $\mathcal{A}$. Firstly, examining this function when using the coordinate $v'$ gives
\[
\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - ku = \frac{w(\iu u)v'}{uv'-1} - ku,
\]
which is analytic. Next, when using the coordinate $u'$ we have
\begin{align}
\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - k u
&= \frac{w(\iu u) - ku^2}{u-v} + \frac{kuv}{u-v} \\
&= \frac{1 + (1+k^2)u^2}{(u-v) (w(\iu u) + ku^2)} + \frac{kv}{1-u'v} \\
&= \frac{u'((u')^2 + (1+k^2)} {(1-u'v) (w'(\iu u') + k)} + \frac{kv}{1-u'v},
\end{align}
where we have introduced the shorthand $w'(z')^2 = (1-(z')^2)(k^2 - (z')^2)$ to deal with this function at infinity. This is now an analytic function of $u'$. As these three coordinate patches cover all of $\mathcal{A}$, we are done and there is no need to consider the case using both $u'$ and $v'$, though this case is easy to derive from the last expression, and also clearly analytic.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

In Appendix \ref{sub:EllipticContinuation}, extensions of $F_0(x;k)$ and $E_0(x;k)$ to the universal covers of $(k,x)\in (0,1)\times\RInf$ are constructed. They are denoted respectively as $\tilde{F}$ and $\tilde{E}$. Thus the first two brackets of $T_0$ can be lifted to the universal cover by simply swapping to those ready-made functions. The previous lemma has established that the third bracket is analytic, and so lifts to the universal cover without the need for modifcation at all. Therefore we define
\[
2π \tilde{T}(p,k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v})
= 4p \left[ E \tilde{F}(\tilde{v}) - K \tilde{E}(\tilde{v}) \right]
- 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\tilde{u}) - K \tilde{E}(\tilde{u}) \right]
- 4 K \left[p\left\{\frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} + kv \right\}
+ \left\{\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - ku \right\} \right] .
\]
If we wish to relate this to a specific local expression, it is simply a matter of substituting the correct expression for $\tilde{F}$ or $\tilde{E}$, \'a la \ref{eqn:tildeF_period} and \ref{eqn:tildeE_period}. In particular, define the winding number $W : \R \to \Z$ of a number $x$ to be the integer $W(x)$ such that $-π < x - 2πW(x) < π$. Then
\begin{align*}
2π \tilde{T}(p,k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v})
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&= 4p \left[ E (2K'W(\tilde{v})+F_0(v)) - K (2(K'-E')W(\tilde{v})+E_0(v)) \right] \\
&\quad - 4 \left[ E (2K'W(\tilde{u})+F_0(u)) - K (2(K'-E')W(\tilde{u})+E_0(u)) \right]
- 4 K \left[p\left\{\frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} + kv \right\}
+ \left\{\frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} - ku \right\} \right] \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
&= 4p \left[ 2EK' - 2K(K'-E') \right]W(\tilde{v})
- 4 \left[ 2EK' - 2K(K'-E') \right]W(\tilde{u}) + T_0(p,k,u,v)\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\tilde{T}(p,k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v})
&= 2\bra{ pW(\tilde{v}) - W(\tilde{u}) } + T_0(p,k,u,v) .
\end{align*}
Thus to do computations with the function $\tilde{T}$, one can continue to work with a function downstairs on $\mathcal{A}$ and make a note of the constants.



























\subsection{The topology of the moduli space}

In the interest of having manageable formulae, we recall the definition of $w'(z')^2 = (1 - (z')^2)(k^2 - (z')^2)$. As $F(z;k)$ and $E(z;k)$ are parameter integrals in $z$, we have that
\[
\Partial{}{u} F(\iu u; k) = \frac{\iu}{w(\iu u)},\;\;\;
\Partial{}{u} E(\iu u; k) = \iu\frac{1+k^2 u^2}{w(\iu u)},
\]
and
\[
\Partial{}{u} w(\iu u)
= \Partial{}{u} \sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+k^2 u^2}
= \frac{(1+k^2)u + 2k^2 u^3}{w(\iu u)}.
\]
The other derivatives of elliptic integrals are calculated in appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic Integrals}. Equipped with these tools, the calculation of the derivatives of $T_0$ is elementary if tedious.
% \begin{align*}\label{dTdk}
% \frac{π}{2}\Partial{T_0}{k}
% &= \frac{1}{k(1-k^2)}\frac{1}{u-v} \left[ p \sqrt { \frac{1+v^2}{1+k^2v^2}} + \sqrt { \frac{1+u^2}{1+k^2u^2} } \right] \left[ -(1+k^2uv) E + (1-k^2)K \right]
% \end{align*}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdu}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T_0}{u}
= -\frac{E}{w(\iu u)} + \frac{pK w(\iu v)}{(u-v)^2} + \frac{K}{w(\iu u)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdv}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T_0}{v}
= \frac{pE}{w(\iu v)} - \frac{K w(\iu u)}{(u-v)^2} - \frac{pK}{w(\iu v)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
While $T$ may be multivalued on $\mathcal{A}'$, its derivatives are not: the ambiguity of being locally defined only up to a constant is removed by differentiation. Henceforth we can drop the subscript $0$ on derivatives.


\begin{equation}\label{dTdu'}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{u'}
= \frac{E}{w'(u')} + \frac{pK w(\iu v)}{(1-u'v)^2} + \frac{K}{w'(u')(1-u'v)^2}\left[1 + k^2v^2 + - u'v + k^2u'v + (u')^2 + (u')^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdv'}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v'}
= -\frac{pE}{w'(v')} + \frac{K w(\iu u)}{(uv'-1)^2} + \frac{pK}{w'(v')(uv'-1)^2}\left[1 + k^2u^2 - uv' + k^2uv' + (v')^2 + u^2(v')^2 \right]
\end{equation}

\begin{lem}
    \label{lem:deriv no zeroes}
The functions
\[
U(p,k,u,v) := -(u-v)^2 E + pKw(\iu u)w(\iu v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right]
\]
and
\[
V(p,k,u,v') := -(uv'-1)^2 E + pKw(\iu u)w'(v') + K\left[ 1 + k^2u^2 - uv' + k^2 uv' + (v')^2 + u^2 (v')^2 \right]
\]
have no zeroes for $p \geq 1$, $k\in (0,1)$, $u,v,v' \in \R$.
\begin{proof}
We shall prove this statement by showing that the two functions are in fact always positive. The first step is to eliminate $E$. We apply the crude estimate that $K>E$, \todo{reference the appendix}
and also the assumption that $p\geq 1$, to simplify
\begin{align*}
U(p,k,u,v)
&= -(u-v)^2 E + pKw(\iu u)w(\iu v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&> -(u-v)^2 K + Kw(\iu u)w(\iu v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&= K \left[ w(\iu u)w(\iu v) + 1 + (1 + k^2) uv + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right]
\end{align*}
This formula is almost sufficent. The only term that could be negative is the one featuring $uv$. However, a lower bound for the square root terms is
\[
w(\iu u) = \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)u^2 + k^2u^4} > \sqrt{(1+k^2)u^2} = \sqrt{(1+k^2)}\abs{u},
\]
so
\begin{align*}
U(p,k,u,v)
&> K \left[ (1+k^2)\abs{uv} + 1 + (1 + k^2) uv + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&\geq K \left[ 1 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right].
\end{align*}
This is positive, so $U$ is without zeroes. Taking a similar approach for $V$
\[
V(x,k,u,v') > K \left[ w(\iu u) w'(v') + (1+k^2)uv' + k^2u^2 + (v')^2\right].
\]
In addition to the bound for $w(\iu u)$, we also now require a lower bound for $w'(v')$:
\[
w(v') = \sqrt{k^2 + (1+k^2)(v')^2 + (v')^4} > \sqrt{(1+k^2)(v')^2} = \sqrt{(1+k^2)}\abs{v'},
\]
which can now be applied to show that
\[
V(x,k,u,v') > K \left[k^2u^2 + (v')^2\right].
\]
This establishes that $V$ has no roots either.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

This result is of interest because it shows that if $p \leq 1$, then the $v$ and $v'$ derivatives of $T$ are nonzero:
\begin{align*}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v} &= \frac{-p}{w(\iu v)(u-v)^2} U\bra{ \frac{1}{p},k,u,v }, \\
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v'} &= \frac{p}{w'(v')(uv'-1)^2} V\bra{ \frac{1}{p},k,u,v' }.
\end{align*}
And if $p \geq 1$, then the $u$ and $u'$ derivatives of $T$ are nonzero:
\begin{align*}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{u} &= \frac{1}{w(\iu u)(u-v)^2} U\bra{ p,k,u,v }, \\
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{u'} &= \frac{-1}{w'(u')(1-u'v)^2} V\bra{ p,k,v,u' }.
\end{align*}


Recall that $\mathcal{S} \subset \mathcal{C}$ is the set of spectral curves that admit closing spectral data and that $\mathcal{\tilde{S}} \subset \mathcal{\mathcal{A}}$ is its preimage in the universal cover. Let $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q)$ denote the subset of $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$ on which the values of $p(α,β) = p$ and $\tilde{T} = q$ are fixed. As we have shown that $\mathcal{S}$ is the space on which $p$ is a positive rational and $q$ is any rational (lemma \ref{lem:closing_conds}), it follows that
\[
\mathcal{\tilde{S}} = \coprod_{p\in \Q^+,\; q\in \Q} \mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q).
\]

\begin{lem}
If $p \leq 1$ then $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}(p,q)$ is a graph over $(k,\tilde{u})$, and if $p \geq 1$ then $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}(p,q)$ is a graph over $(k, \tilde{v})$.

\begin{proof}
We prove this by direct application of the implict function theorem. Suppose first that $p \leq 1$. Consider the function $\tilde{T}(p,k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v})$ on $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$. Consider two formulae for its derivatives with respect to $\tilde{v}$.
\[
\Partial{\tilde{T}}{\tilde{v}}
= \Partial{T}{v}\frac{dv}{d\tilde{v}}
= \frac{1}{2}\sec^2\bfrac{\tilde{v}}{2} \Partial{T}{v},
\]
for $\tilde{v} \not\in π + 2π\Z$ and
\[
\Partial{\tilde{T}}{\tilde{v}}
= \Partial{T}{v'}\frac{dv'}{d\tilde{v}}
= -\frac{1}{2}\csc^2\bfrac{\tilde{v}}{2} \Partial{T}{v'},
\]
for $\tilde{v} \not\in 2π\Z$. As witnessed in Lemma \ref{lem:deriv no zeroes}, neither of the partial derivatives of $T$ with respect to $v$ or $v'$ are ever zero, and neither are $\sec$ or $\csc$. Hence $\partial \tilde{T} / \partial \tilde{v}$ is never zero. By the implicit function theorem therefore, there is a function $h$ such that the level set $\tilde{T}=q$ is a graph of the form $(p, k, \tilde{u}, h(p,k,\tilde{u}))$. Fixing a value of $p$ gives $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q)$ as a graph of the two remaining coordinates $(k,\tilde{u})$.

The same argument holds if $p \geq 1$, as then the $\tilde{u}$ derivative of $\tilde{T}$ is nonvanishing.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

The topological implication of this is that each path component of the moduli space $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}$ is diffeomorphic to a product of $(0,1)$ and $\R$ where $k$ is in the interval and the real parameter is either $\tilde{u}$ or $\tilde{v}$ depending on the magnitude of $p$. For brevity, we will refer to it as $\tilde{x}$. To understand the topology of $\mathcal{S}$, we must understand the action of the deck transformations as restricted to $\tilde{\mathcal{S}}$. There are two types of transformations to understand, the transformations of $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$ over $\mathcal{A}$ and the transformations of the two fold covering of $\mathcal{A}$ over $\mathcal{C}$.

The first sort are easy to understand; they are generated by the translation
\[
(p, k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) \mapsto (p, k, \tilde{u} + 2π, \tilde{v} + 2π).
\]
The second sort require a little more effort. On one hand, the deck transformations of $\mathcal{A}$ over $\mathcal{C}$ is simply the involution that swaps $α$ and $β$. The difficulty is what this action looks like when pulled back to the universal cover. By inspection of the defintions of $p$ and $k$, they are unchanged if the labbeling of the branch points is exchanged. We therefore must say what happens to $u$ and $v$. Our construction thus far relies on the standardisation in the definition of $f$ that sends $α$ to $1$ and $β$ to $k^{-1}$. Let $f_s$ be the map which instead standardises the roots of the spectral curve in the other way, taking $β$ to $1$. Consider the composition of $f_s \circ f^{-1}$. It is a M\"obius transformation that exchanges $1$ and $k^{-1}$ and also $-1$ and $-k^{-1}$. It therefore must be the map
\[
z \mapsto \frac{1}{kz}.
\]
Under the composite map $\iu u$ is taken to $-\iu u^{-1}$. Ditto for $\iu v$. Using the map $f_s$ instead of $f$ is equivalent to swapping the labels on the branch points and then applying $f$. Thus, under the label-swapping involution,
\[
(p,k,u,v) \mapsto \bra{ p,k, -(ku)^{-1}, -(kv)^{-1} }.
\]
This then carries on to the universal cover in the following way. For some integer $n$
\[
\tilde{u} = 2πn + 2\atan u \mapsto 2πn + 2\atan \bra{ -\frac{1}{ku} } = 2πn + π + 2\atan (ku).
\]
Applying the transformation again
\[
2πn + π + 2\atan (ku) \mapsto 2πn + π + 2\atan \bra{ -\frac{k}{ku} } = 2π(n+1) + 2\atan u = \tilde{u} + 2π.
\]
The same applies to $\tilde{v}$. This shows that deck transformations of $\mathcal{\tilde{A}}$ over $\mathcal{A}$ are actually a subgroup of the group generated by the label-swapping involution. Hence we can focus our attention solely on the latter.

How does the value of $T$ change when this transformation is precomposed? To see this, it is useful to consider the situation in the $ζ$-plane. Suppose for concreteness that $μ$ and $ν$ are chosen such that $ν,μ,1$ and $-1$ are arranged clockwise as shown in the following diagram. The principal choice of path $γ_+$ is shown in black, whereas its pullback under the exchange of the roots is shown in red. Let it be denoted $γ'_+$.

\begin{center}
\includegraphics[height=50mm]{thesis_graphics_temp/deck_T_1.png}
\end{center}

The difference between these two paths is homologous to a loop anticlockwise around the upper unit circle. So by the normalisation of $Θ^2$,
\[
\int_{γ'_+} Θ^2 - \int_{γ_+} Θ^2 = \int_{\S^1} = -2π\iu.
\]

Likewise if we consider the difference between the path $γ_-$ and its pullback $γ'_-$ we again have a anticlockwise loop of the upper unit circle.
\begin{center}
    \includegraphics[height=50mm]{thesis_graphics_temp/deck_T_1.png}
\end{center}
Hence
\[
\int_{γ'_-} Θ^2 - \int_{γ_-} Θ^2 = \int_{\S^1} = -2π\iu.
\]
Putting these together we conclude that the value of $T_0$ changes by $1-p$ under this transformation.
\[
2π\iu (T_0 \circ g - T_0) = \bra{ p\int_{γ'_-} Θ^2 - \int_{γ'_+} Θ^2 } - \bra{ p\int_{γ_-} Θ^2 - \int_{γ_+} Θ^2 } = p(-2π\iu) - (-2π\iu) = 2π\iu (1-p).
\]

To infer what the effect of the transformation is on $\tilde{T}$ however, we also must take into account how the coordinates $\tilde{u},\tilde{v}$ may have changed, and consequently altered their winding numbers. If the points $μ,ν$ have been arranged as described, then this restricts the arrangement of $\iu u$ $\iu v$. In particular, as one tranverses the unit circle clockwise, one traverse the imaginary axis in the $z$-plane from bottom to top. Correspondingly, $-\infty < 0 < u < v$.

As $u,v$ are both positive, it must be that $\tilde{u} \in (2πn, 2πn + π)$ and $\tilde{v} \in (2πm, 2πm + π)$ for some integers $n,m$. $2\atan(ku)$ will be between $0$ and $π$, so after the transformation $\tilde{u}$ will be in the range $(2πn +π, 2π(n+1))$. In otherwords its winding number has incresed by $1$. The same can be said for $\tilde{v}$. Putting these two parts together
\[
\tilde{T} \circ g - \tilde{T}
= \bra{ T_0 \circ g + 2(p(m+1)-(n+1)) } - \bra{ T_0 + 2(pm-n) }
= 1-p  +2(p-1) = p-1.
\]
This relation is a difference of analytic functions on an open set, so by continuation it applies everywhere. Thus the effect of the deck transformation on $\tilde{T}$ is to increase its value by $p-1$.







Thus, if we consider the surfaces $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q)$ parameterised by $(p,q,k,\tilde{x})$, where $\tilde{x}$ is mapped to either $\tilde{u}$ or $\tilde{v}$ depending on the magnitude of $p$, we see that under the generating deck transformation
\[
(p,q,k,\tilde{x}) \mapsto (p, q + (p-1), k, \tilde{x}')
\]
where $\tilde{x}' = 2πn+ π + 2\atan (k \tan (\tilde{x}/2))$. This provides an identification between $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q)$ and $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q + k(p-1))$ for any integral $k$.

\begin{thm}
For $p\neq 1$, $\mathcal{S}(p)$ is topologically
\[
\bra{\Q/ (p-1)\Z} \times (0,1) \times \R.
\]
\begin{proof}
Fix $p\neq 1$ and consider the part of $\mathcal{S}$ with such a fixed value of $p$. It is the quotient of $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p)$ by the covering transformations, which as one can note preserve the value of $p$. We have already shown how different path components $\mathcal{\tilde{S}}(p,q)$ can be indentified if their values of $q$ differ by a multiple of $p-1$. Hence it is sufficent to take one representative from each of $\Q/(p-1)\Z$ to cover the image. The diffeomorphism between each path component and $(0,1)\times\R$ has already been noted above.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}

This leaves just one special case.

\begin{thm}
$\mathcal{S}(1)$ is topologically
\[
\Q \times (0,1) \times \bra{\R/2π\Z}.
\]
\begin{proof}
In this special case, we see that the action does not identify path components with different values of $q$; in fact $p-1$ is zero, so $q$ is fixed under the deck transformations. Consequently, the shifting action identifies values of $\tilde{x}$ that differ by $2π$ in the same path component, resulting in annuli.
\end{proof}
\end{thm}
