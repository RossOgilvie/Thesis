\section{Genus Zero}
\label{sec:Genus Zero}

The moduli space of spectral data where the spectral curve is genus zero is an instructive case.
It is possible to describe this space using only elementary functions, so we will give explicit formulae for all such harmonic maps $f$ and their associated solutions $(A,Φ)$ to \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7} and spectral data $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$. These formulae will allow us to illustrate the correspondences between certain properties of the map and its spectral data. The process of deriving the spectral data from a formula of a harmonic map also serves as a demonstration of the spectral curve construction that was outlined in Section \ref{sub:construction}. Finally, we may describe the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_0$ as a disjoint union of discs to both give an example of the results of the previous chapter and as a guide for the description of $\mathcal{M}_1$ in the subsequent chapter.

The derivations within this chapter may be divided into three parts. In the first part, we start with equations \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7} and find all translation invariant solutions. Amoung these solutions, we determine which correspond to harmonic maps from a torus by forcing a periodicity constraint. We then write an explict formula for each harmonic map, and bring it into a standard form by applying rotations. In the second part, we take these harmonic maps and work through the steps of Section \ref{sub:construction} to produce the associated spectral data. Further calculations give rise to formulae for the infinitesimal deformations in terms of derivative of the branch point, and an expression of the energy of the harmonic map.

Let us start then by finding all translation invariant pairs $(A,Φ)$ solving equations \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7}. By translation invariance we mean that, for $z\in\C$ a uniformising coordinate on the torus $M = \C/\Z\langle 1,τ\rangle$, we may write the Higgs field as $Φ = F \,dz$ and the connection as $d''_A = d'' + G \,d\bar{z}$ with respect to the trivialisation arising from the translation action, for constant traceless matrices $F$ and $G$ (compare to \cite[(9.11)]{Hitchin1990}). With these definitions, equations \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7} become
\[
[F,G] = 0\;\; \text{and}\;\; [G,G^*] = [F,F^*].
\]
If $F$ commutes with its conjugate-transpose then so too does $G$, and they are simultaneously diagonalisable by an $\SU(2)$ matrix. This case corresponds to a conformal map from the torus to a $2$-sphere, which does not produce a spectral curve \cite[Prop~3.14]{Hitchin1990}. Assume therefore that $[F,F^*] \neq 0$. The first equation implies that $F$ and $G$ commute, so we may write $G = λF$. Then $(\abs{λ}^2 - 1)[F,F^*] = 0$ implies that $\abs{λ}=1$. Let $κ\in\S^1$ be such that $\bar{κ}^2=λ$.

Hence a translation invariant solution to \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7} is given by a constant traceless matrix $F$ and a complex number $κ\in\S^1$, with $G = \bar{κ}^2 F$. Recall equation \eqref{eqn:flat connections}, that for any solution for \eqref{eqn:Hit1.7} there is an $\S^1$ family of flat unitary connections, which are given in this case by
\[
d_ζ := d_A + ζ^{-1}Φ - ζΦ^*
= d + G\,d\bar{z} - G^*\,dz + ζ^{-1}F\,dz - ζF^*\,d\bar{z},
\labelthis{eqn:flat connection translation}
\]
for $ζ\in\S^1$. As the matrices $F$ and $G$ are constant, for each $ζ$ one can solve the parallel transport equation $d_ζ X = 0$ explicitly by exponentiation.
One may then recover the associated harmonic map as the change of gauge between two parallel vector fields for the connections $d_1$ and $d_{-1}$, as in \eqref{eqn:gauge change}.
After factorising, we write the harmonic map as
\[
f(z) = \exp[ (κz + \bar{κ}\bar{z})(-\bar{κ}F + κF^*) ]
\exp[ (κz - \bar{κ}\bar{z})(-\bar{κ}F - κF^*) ].
\]
We may simplify this formula by making the following substitutions. On the torus,  make the change of coordinates $w = κz$ and let $w = w_R + \iu w_I$ be the sum of its real and imaginary parts. We note that $\sl_2\C$ can be decomposed as a direct sum $\su_2 \oplus \iu \su_2$. If we decompose $\bar{κ}F = X + \iu Y$ for $X,Y\in \su_2$ then we may replace the two expressions $-\bar{κ}F + κF^*$ and $-\bar{κ}F - κF^*$ by the real and imaginary parts of $κF$. With these substitutions, the above formula becomes
\[
f(w) = \exp( -4w_R X ) \exp( 4 w_I Y ).
\labelthis{eqn:genus zero simple map}
\]
The matrix exponential of an $\su_2$ matrix is of course an $\SU(2)$ matrix, and a line through the origin of $\su_2$, such as $\Set{-4w_R X }{w_R \in \R}$, is mapped to a one parameter subgroup of $\SU(2)$, a circle. As we vary $w_R$, the image of $\exp (-4w_R X)$ is a circle and so for a fixed value of $w_I$, the image of $f$ is the right translation of this circle by $\exp (4w_I Y)$. The same is true if we fix $w_R$ and vary $w_I$. Immediately therefore we can see \eqref{eqn:genus zero simple map} as the product of two circles, and hence the image is a torus.

Not all solutions to \ref{eqn:Hit1.7} correspond to harmonic maps of the torus, and thus far this map $f$ is only a map from the plane $z\in\C$ to $\SU(2)$. It induces a map on the torus $M$ when it periodic with respect to the lattice $\Z\langle 1,τ\rangle$. Thus we must show firstly that the map is periodic and then determine for which matrices $X,Y$ and rotations $κ$ do these periods lie in the lattice. To do so we will need to know how to compute explicitly the matrix exponential of an $\su_2$ matrix.

Calculations with $\su_2$ matrices are far more pleasant when one leverages their underlying geometry.
We may identify $\su_2$ with $\R^3 = \R\langle i,j,k\rangle$ via the standard basis of $\su_2$
\[
σ_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
\iu & 0 \\ 0 & -\iu
\end{pmatrix} \mapsto i, \quad
σ_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}\mapsto j, \quad
σ_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \iu \\ \iu & 0
\end{pmatrix} \mapsto k.
\]
If $\langle\cdot,\cdot\rangle_{\R^3}$ and $\times_{\R^3}$ are the usual inner and cross products of $\R^3$ then the multiplication of two matrices $A,B \in \su_2$ may be computed as
\[
AB = -\langle A, B\rangle_{\R^3} I + (A\times_{\R^3} B).
\labelthis{eqn:su2 product}
\]
Further, this identification puts an inner product on $\su_2$, given by
\[
\langle A, B \rangle_{\su_2} = -\frac{1}{2}\tr AB.
\]
This inner product is actually the same as the metric that arises by considering $\SU(2)$ as $\S^3$. From this formula, the norm of an $\su_2$ matrix is the square root of its determinant. We define the unit matrix $\hat{Z}$ in direction $Z$ to be $Z$ divided by its norm. With these definitions, note that $Z^2 = -\abs{Z}^2 I$ and hence the matrix exponential may be written concisely as
\[
\exp Z = I \cos \abs{Z} + \hat{Z} \sin \abs{Z}.
\]

Given this explicit formula for the matrix exponential, we now compute the periods of the map $f$. By the assumption that the matrix $F = κ(X+\iu Y)$ does not commute with its conjugate-transpose, $X$ and $Y$ are linearly independent. If $a+\iu b$ is a point such that $f(a+\iu b) = I$ then $\exp(4aX ) = \exp(4bY)$, and so by linear independence they must both equal $\pm I$. For any $w\in\C$ it follows that
\begin{align*}
f(w + a +\iu b)
&= \exp( -4(w_R+a) X ) \exp( 4 (w_I+b) Y ) \\
&= \exp( -4aX ) \exp( -4w_R X ) \exp( 4 b Y ) \exp( 4 w_I Y ) \\
&= (\pm I)^2 \exp( -4w_R X ) \exp( 4 w_I Y ) \\
&= f(w),
\end{align*}
and thus $a+\iu b$ is a period. The converse, that $f(w)=I$ if $w$ is a period, is trivial. Thus $f$ is periodic, and its periods are precisely the points where it takes the value $I$.

We have reduced the task of finding the periods of $f$ to that of solving $f(w)=I$. Again because $X$ and $Y$ are linearly independent matrices, the set $\{I,X,Y,XY\}$ is linearly independent by \eqref{eqn:su2 product}. An element $w\in\C$ is a period of $f$ exactly when
\begin{align*}
f(w) = I \cos(4w_R\abs{X})&\cos(4w_I\abs{Y})
- \hat{X}\sin(4w_R\abs{X})\cos(4w_I\abs{Y}) \\
&+ \hat{Y}\cos(4w_R\abs{X})\sin(4w_I\abs{Y})
- \hat{X}\hat{Y}\sin(4w_R\abs{X})\sin(4w_I\abs{Y}) = I
\end{align*}
Squaring and adding the coefficients of $\hat{Y}$ and $\hat{X}\hat{Y}$ together shows that $\sin^2(4w_I\abs{Y}) = 0$, and likewise for $\hat{X}$ and $\hat{X}\hat{Y}$ that $\sin^2(4w_R\abs{X}) = 0$. Let $4w_R\abs{X} = πk$ and $4w_I\abs{Y} = πl$. Then the remaining term, the coefficient of $I$, requires that
\[
1 = \cos(4w_I\abs{Y})\cos(4w_R\abs{X}) = (-1)^k (-1)^l = (-1)^{k+l}.
\]
Thus the lattice of the periods of $f$, expressed in the variable $w$, is generated by
\[
κ_1 := \frac{π}{4}\bra{\frac{1}{\abs{X}} - \iu\frac{1}{\abs{Y}}},
\;\;\;\text{and}\;\;\;
κ_2 := -\frac{π}{4}\bra{\frac{1}{\abs{X}} + \iu\frac{1}{\abs{Y}}}.
\labelthis{eqn:def kappa12}
\]

\makefigure{The lattice of periods of $f$.}{thesis_graphics_temp/genus_zero_lattice.png}

The geometric meaning of $κ$, $\abs{X}$, and $\abs{Y}$ are now apparent; they determine the size and rotational offset of the lattice of periods of $f$. The three parameters must be chosen so that $1$ and $τ$ are points of this lattice of periods $\Z\langle \bar{κ}κ_1,\bar{κ}κ_2 \rangle$.
That is, there must be integers $n,m,\tilde{n},\tilde{m}$
\[
κ = n κ_1 + m κ_2,\;\;
κτ = \tilde{n} κ_1 + \tilde{m} κ_2.
\labelthis{eqn:def kappa}
\]
Eliminating $κ$ and solving for $τ$ yields
\[
τ
= \frac{(\tilde{n} + \tilde{m}) + \iu x(\tilde{n} - \tilde{m})}
{(n+m) +\iu x(n-m)},
\labelthis{eqn:conformal type}
\]
for $x = \frac{\abs{Y}}{\abs{X}}$. To turn this around, if one begins with the parameters $κ,\abs{X}$ and $\abs{Y}$ then this shows that the conformal type of domain of the map $f$ depends on $x$ and four integers. These four integers may be interpreted as winding numbers of the map. A homology basis of the domain torus is spanned by the straight-line paths from $0$ to $1$ and from $0$ to $τ$. The parallelogram spanned by $z_0$ and $z_1$ covers the image exactly once. Thus the integers $n,mm \tilde{n}$ and $\tilde{m}$ determine how many times the fundamental loop of the domain are wrapped around the image.

Before proceeding to the second part of this example, where we compute the spectral data associated to the map $f$, we may further simplify \eqref{eqn:genus zero simple map}. The correspondence between spectral data and harmonic maps does not distinguish between maps that differ by an $\SO(4)$ rotation of $\S^3 = \SU(2)$. We may use this freedom of rotation to align $X$ in the direction of $σ_2$ and have $Y$ lie in the plane spanned by $σ_2$ and $σ_3$ such that $(X,Y)$ carries the same orientation as $(σ_2,σ_3)$. After this rotation, $X = \abs{X}σ_2$ and for some $δ\in (0,π)$,
\[
Y = \abs{Y} \begin{pmatrix}
0 & e^{\iu δ} \\ -e^{-\iu δ} & 0
\end{pmatrix}.
\]
Using the inner product on $\su_2$, we may consider $δ$ as the angle between $X$ and $Y$. This transformation of $f$ into a standard form shows that the image of $f$ is determined by the angle $δ\in (0,π)$, up to rotation of $\S^3$.

PICTURES OF THE MAPS FOR DIFFERENT DELTAS.

We now turn to computing the spectral data associated to one of these harmonic maps. We may unwind the substitutions to express $F$ as
\[
F = κ\abs{X} \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 + \iu xe^{\iu δ} \\ -1-\iu xe^{-\iu δ} & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\]
and likewise $G = \bar{κ}^2 F$. Recall the family of flat connections \eqref{eqn:flat connection translation}. Again, because we can explicitly solve the parallel transport equations, we can easily compute the holonomy matrices. For a connection $d_ζ$, the holomony matrix for the loop from $z=0$ to $1$ is
\[
H(ζ) = \exp (- G + G^* - ζ^{-1}F + ζ F^*),
\]
and for the loop from $z=0$ to $τ$ it is
\begin{align*}
\tilde{H}(ζ)
&= \exp (- G\bar{τ} + G^*τ - ζ^{-1}Fτ + ζ F^*\bar{τ}) \\
&= \exp \left\{ ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)\abs{X} \begin{pmatrix}
0 & -\left[ (1 + \iu xe^{\iu δ}) - (-1 + \iu x e^{\iu δ})ζ \right] \\
\left[ (1+\iu xe^{-\iu δ}) + (1-\iu xe^{-\iu δ})ζ  \right] & 0
\end{pmatrix}\right\}.
\end{align*}
We note that setting $τ=1$ above recovers the formula for $H(ζ)$, so we shall do all our computations with $\tilde{H}$.

To compute the spectral curve, we find the values of $ζ$ for which the two eigenlines of $\tilde{H}(ζ)$ coincide. If $\tilde{B}(ζ)$ is defined by $\tilde{H}(ζ) = \exp \tilde{B}(ζ)$, then the eigenspaces of $\tilde{H}(ζ)$ and $\tilde{B}(ζ)$ are the same, so me may do our computation with the latter. The matrix $\tilde{B}(ζ)$ is off-diagonal, so $v(ζ) = (v_1(ζ)\; v_2(ζ))^T$ is an eigenvector if and only if
\[
-ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)\abs{X}(1 - \iu x e^{\iu δ})(ζ-α) v_2(ζ)^2
= ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)\abs{X}(1+\iu xe^{-\iu δ}) (1-\bar{α}ζ) v_1(ζ)^2.
\]
where $α$ is a point that is always inside the unit circle, given by
\[
α = \frac{1+\iu x e^{\iu δ}}{-1+\iu x e^{\iu δ}}
= \frac{x e^{\iu δ} - \iu}{x e^{\iu δ} +\iu}.
\labelthis{eqn:def branch point genus zero}
\]
Points of the eigenline curve, in $\CP^1 \times\CP^1$, are therefore of the form
\begin{align*}
&\bra{ζ, \left[\pm \sqrt{-ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)\abs{X}(1 - \iu x e^{\iu δ})(ζ-α)} : \sqrt{ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)\abs{X}(1+\iu xe^{-\iu δ}) (1-\bar{α}ζ)} \right] } \\
&\qquad= \bra{ζ, \left[\pm \sqrt{-\abs{X}(1 - \iu x e^{\iu δ})(ζ-α)} : \sqrt{\abs{X}(1+\iu xe^{-\iu δ}) (1-\bar{α}ζ)} \right] }.
\end{align*}
From this we can see where and to what order the eigenlines coincide. They coincide when one of the homogeneous coordinates vanish, with the order of coincidence the same as the order of the root. As $\iu x e^{\iu δ}$ is always in the left half of the complex plane, $1 - \iu x e^{\iu δ}$ and its conjugate $1 + \iu x e^{-\iu δ}$ never vanish. Hence the eigenlines coincide only over $α$ and $\cji{α}$, and only to first order. The spectral curve is therefore $η^2 = (ζ-α)(1-\bar{α}ζ)$, a genus zero hyperelliptic curve without singularities.

Let us explore how variation of the parameter $α$ may alter the properties of the harmonic map $f$, and provide some nonrigorous intutition about the limit as $α$ approaches the unit circle. From \eqref{eqn:def branch point genus zero}, we can see how the two continuous parameters $δ$ and $x$ have been incorporated into the definition of $α$. If we treat $xe^{\iu δ}$ as a point in the upper half plane, \eqref{eqn:def branch point genus zero} is a M\"obius transformation to the unit disc. One can write the inverse transformation as
\[
x e^{\iu δ} = \iu \frac{1+α}{1-α}.
\]
Taking the magnitude of both sides shows that $x$ is constant along arcs such that
\[
\abs{\frac{1+α}{1-α}},
\]
is fixed. These are arcs of circles centered on the real axis with radii such that the circle is perpendicular to the unit circle. If $x$ is constant, so is $τ$, and so along these arc the corresponding family of harmonic maps have the same domain but images changing as in REF TO PICTURES.

In the limit as $α$ approaches the unit circle for fixed $x$, $δ$ tends to $0$ or $π$ and the image of the harmonic map collapses into a circle, specifically a one-parameter subgroup of $\SU(2)$. A harmonic map to a circle is a particular case of a conformal map to a totally geodesic $2$-sphere, the class of harmonic tori in $\S^3$ which do not produce spectral curves by the construction of Section \ref{sub:construction}. In Chapter \ref{sec:Moduli Boundary}, we will develop a process whereby a curve that has a double point on the unit circle, and which is the limit of a sequence of spectral curves, is normalised to produce a spectral curve of lower genus. The analogous process is not possible here however, as the normalisation of $η^2 = e^{-\iu \varphi} (ζ- e^{\iu \varphi})^2$ is the disjoint union of two spheres, which does not fit into the defintion of a marked curve (cf Section \ref{sub:marked curve}). One can however appreciate the moral sentiment that a limit of spectral curves which develops a singularity should be normalised to spectral curve of lower genus, and that this should correspond the harmonic maps deforming (or degenerating) to `simpler' harmonic map.

\makefigure{Constant parameter lines.}{thesis_graphics_temp/genus_zero_parameters.png}

Conversely if $δ$ is fixed, say at $δ=π/2$, then $α$ is given by
\[
α = \frac{x-1}{x+1},
\]
and takes values along the real axis. Throughout this deformation, the image of the corresponding harmonic maps is fixed, it is only the domain that is changing. We will say more on this variation of the conformal paramter $τ$ below (see \eqref{eqn:conformal covering change}).

The two extremes, when $α=-1$ or $1$, correspond to $x=0$ and $\infty$ respectively. In these two limits, one of $\abs{X}$ or $\abs{Y}$ is dwarfing the other, which by \eqref{eqn:def kappa12} shows that in one direction the lattice of periods is becoming neglible. Another way to put this is that the limit the lattice of periods will be only rank one, not rank two. Thus we should interpret this limit as corresponding to a harmonic map of the cylinder. Towards the end of this chapter, when we compute the energy of these maps, we will see that as we aproach the two points $α=\pm 1$ the torus tends to having infinite area, which support this interpretation.

Again, we shall see the features of this limit in the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_1$, of spectral data with a genus one curve; the limit of a spectral curve when one of its branch points tends towards $\pm 1$ is qualitatively different than when it tends to another point on the unit circle. We shall also see that there is a sense in which the disjoint components of the moduli space are `pinched' together at these two points.


Having found the spectral curve, we continue our quest to find the spectral data of the harmonic map $f$ by computing the pair of differentials. The pair of differentials $Θ,\tilde{Θ}$ arise as the derivatives of the logarithms of the eigenvalues $μ,\tilde{μ}$ of the holonomy matrices $H,\tilde{H}$ respectively. The two eigenvalues of $\tilde{H}$ are $(\tilde{μ})^{\pm 1} = \exp (\pm \tilde{ν})$, so in this example $\tilde{Θ} = d\log \tilde{μ} = d\tilde{ν}$. To compute $\tilde{ν}$, an eigenvalue of $\tilde{B}(ζ)$, we note that as it is a traceless matrix, so
\begin{align*}
\tilde{ν}^2
&= -\det (- G\bar{τ} + G^*τ - ζ^{-1}Fτ + ζ F^*\bar{τ}) \\
&= -ζ^{-2}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ)^2 \abs{X}^2 \abs{1- \iu xe^{\iu δ}}^2 (ζ-α)(1-\bar{α}ζ).
\labelthis{eqn:eigenvalue}
\end{align*}
Therefore the differential $\tilde{Θ}$ corresponding to the eigenvalue of $\tilde{H}(ζ)$ is
\[
\tilde{Θ} = d\,\log \tilde{μ} = d\, \Big[ ζ^{-1}(κτ + \bar{κτ}ζ) \iu\abs{X} \abs{1 - \iu xe^{\iu δ}} η \Big].
\labelthis{eqn:genus zero differential}
\]
Let us pause for a moment to make a small calculation to simplify the coefficients appearing in this equation. First note that by the defintion of $α$, equation \eqref{eqn:def branch point genus zero},
\[
\abs{1-α}
= \frac{2}{\abs{1 - \iu xe^{\iu δ}}},
\text{ and }\;
\abs{1+α}
= \frac{2x}{\abs{1 - \iu xe^{\iu δ}}}.
\]
It follows then
\begin{align*}
r^1 &:= \iu κ_1 \abs{X}\abs{1-\iu x e^{\iu δ}} = \frac{π}{2}\bra{ \frac{1}{\abs{1+α}} + \iu \frac{1}{\abs{1-α}} },
\text{ and } \\
r^2 &:= \iu κ_2 \abs{X}\abs{1-\iu x e^{\iu δ}} = \frac{π}{2}\bra{ \frac{1}{\abs{1+α}} - \iu \frac{1}{\abs{1-α}} },
\end{align*}
and so finally from \eqref{eqn:def kappa} that
\[
κ \iu\abs{X} \abs{1 - \iu xe^{\iu δ}}
= (n κ_1 + m κ_2) \iu\abs{X} \abs{1 - \iu xe^{\iu δ}}
= n r^1 + m r^2.
\]
Therefore the differentials $Θ$ and $\tilde{Θ}$ lie in a lattice spanned by the basis
\[
Ψ^1 := d\, \Big[ ζ^{-1}(r^1 + \bar{r^1}ζ) η \Big] \text{ and }
Ψ^2 := d\, \Big[ ζ^{-1}(r^2 + \bar{r^2}ζ) η \Big].
\labelthis{eqn:genus zero differential basis}
\]
Conversely every differential on $Σ$ that satisfies conditions \ref{P:real curve}--\ref{P:closing} belongs to this lattice. Hence we may identify this lattice of differentials with the lattice of periods of the map $f$, lending weight to the interpretation that the pair of differentials in the spectral data determine the winding of the torus onto its image. This same interpretation holds for the general construction of a harmonic map from spectral data, where the domain of the map is constructed as the parallogram spanned by the pair of differentials.

The final piece of the spectral data, though one that we do not deal with extensively in this thesis, is the eigenline bundle on $Σ$. As $Σ$ is a sphere, up to isomorphism there is only one line bundle for each degree. By condition \ref{P:quaternionic}, the line bundle $E$ must be degree $-1$, so there is a unique choice.





We have computed the spectral data for all maps $f$ of the form \eqref{eqn:genus zero simple map} and noted that they were all and exactly the spectral data with a genus zero spectral curve. Let us turn then to describing the moduli space $\mathcal{M}_0$, of triples $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$, as a whole. We have seen that the marked curve $Σ$ is completely determined by its sole branch point $α$ in the unit disc $D$. And for every $α$ we may choose $Θ$ and $\tilde{Θ}$ from a rank two lattice. However by condition \ref{P:linear independence} they must be real linearly independent. Given a basis of the lattice of differentials, such as $Ψ, \tilde{Ψ}$ above in \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential basis}, we may represent our choice of lattice points in terms of two pairs of integers. Then linear independence is equivalent to the integer matrix
\begin{align*}
\begin{pmatrix}
n & m \\
\tilde{n} & \tilde{m} \\
\end{pmatrix}
\end{align*}
having non-zero determinant. This provides a concise way to refer to the choice of differentials, as a matrix in $\Mat_2^*\Z = \Set{ M \in \Mat_2\Z }{\det M \neq 0}$. The moduli space $\mathcal{M}_0$ may be described as the product $D \times \Mat_2^*\Z$.

This matrix formulation is also well suited to talk about changes of the conformal parameter. Recall that the conformal parameter of the domain of the harmonic map may be computed by taking the ratio of the principal parts of the two differentials of the corresponding spectral data. Observe that if $(Σ,Θ,\tilde{Θ})$ is a triple of spectral data, with conformal paramter $τ$, then so too is $(Σ,nΘ + m\tilde{Θ}, \tilde{n}Θ +\tilde{m}\tilde{Θ})$, and that the new conformal parameter is
\[
\frac{\tilde{n}+\tilde{m}τ}{n + mτ}.
\labelthis{eqn:conformal covering change}
\]
But this is just the action of $\Mat_2^*\Z$ on a point $τ$ in the upper half plane by M\"obius transformations. The conformal type of the domain of the harmonic map corresponding to $(Σ, Ψ, \tilde{Ψ})$, where $Ψ$ and $\tilde{Ψ}$ is the basis \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential basis} given above, is equivalent to
\[
τ = \frac{1-x^2 + 2\iu x}{1+x^2},
\]
so as $α$ moves in the unit disc, $τ$ sweeps out the upper half unit circle. The range of the conformal parameter for any other genus zero harmonic map is the image of this semicircle under some element of $\Mat_2^*\Z$. Hence the possible ranges of the conformal parameter $τ$ under deformation of the harmonic map are semicircles in the upper half plane centered on the real axis with endpoints in $\Q$ (and vertical rays with a rational endpoint, which are a special case).

The previous chapter developed a method for computing the deformations of spectral data. In the genus zero case, it is clear that given a triple of spectral data one can freely move the sole branch point $α$ in the unit disc, and the path of $α$ uniquely determines the deformation. An infinitesimal deformation therefore is determined by the value of the derviative of the branch point, $\dot{α}$. However, let us work through the description of infinitesimal deformations from the previous chapter, via the defintions of the functions $\dot{q}^i$ and $Q$ (equations \eqref{eqn:def q dot} and \eqref{eqn:Q}), to gain some familiarity with its workings.

Because the spectral curve $Σ$ is simply connected in the present situation, all differentials on it are exact. Thus we shall not need to solve \eqref{eqn:EMPDi} to find the polynomials $\hat{c}^i$ and hence $\dot{q}^i$. Instead we may directly compute the functions $q^i$ and differentiate along a deformation. Starting from equation \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential}, the integration is immediate
\[
q^i = ζ^{-1}\bra{s^i - \bar{s}^i ζ}η + C,
\]
for some constant $C$ and $s^i \in \Z\langle r^1, r^2 \rangle$. If the deformation is given by a parameterised path $α(t)$, we may differentiate with respect to a deformation parameter $t$ to deduce
\[
\dot q^i = \frac{1}{ζη}(ζ^2-1)\left[ \bra{-α\dot {\bar s}^i - \frac{1}{2} \bar s^i \dot{α}} + \bra{-\bar{α}\dot{s}^i - \frac{1}{2} s^i \dot{\bar{α}}}ζ \right].
\]
We note the factor $ζ^2 - 1$, which is a consequence of the closing conditions. Also, the remainder after factoring $ζ^2-1$ is a linear imaginary polynomial as expected. That is, $c^i(ζ) \in \mathcal{P}^1_\R$. Next we expand out the derivative in \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential} to find the polynomials $b^i(ζ)$ and subtitute into \eqref{eqn:Q}. Dividing that by $P$ leaves $Q$, which is
\[
Q = \frac{\pi^2}{4}\frac{1}{\abs{1-α^2}}\bra{n^1m^2-n^2m^1} \left[ - 2\iu α \Re \bra{\frac{\dot{α}}{1-α^2}} + (1-α\bar{α})\Im \bra{\frac{\dot{α}}{1-α^2}} ζ + 2\iu \bar{α}\bra{\Re \frac{\dot{α}}{1-α^2}}ζ^2\right].
\]
At a fixed $α$, we see from the form of $Q$ that $Q_0$ can only take values on a real line. This is in accordance with the remark that $Q_0$ determines the change in the conformal parameter (see \eqref{eqn:Q0 change conformal}) and the observation above that during a deformation the conformal parameter $τ$ moves along an arc in the upper half plane.

When $α\neq 0$, the conditions of Lemma \ref{lem:tangent generic} are met.
In this case, the infinitesimal deformation should be completely specified by $Q$.
We see that this is indeed the case, as $Q_0$ and $Q_1$ determine the real and imaginary parts of $\dot{α} (1-α^2)^{-1}$ respectively, which exactly determines the value of $\dot{α}$.

In the conformal case, when $α=0$, we must refer instead to Lemma \ref{lem:tangent conformal}. Here we see that $Q = Q_1 ζ$ as expected. Now however, the deformation is not determined solely by $Q$, as $Q_1 = \Im \dot{α}$ only gives part of the information of $\dot{α}$. However, the infinitesimal deformation is still determined by the polynomials $c^i$,
\[
c^i(ζ) = \frac{1}{2} \bar{s}^i \dot{α} -\frac{1}{2} s^i \dot{\bar{α}}ζ.
\]
The deficit of information in $Q$ is accounted for by a degree of freedom in the solutions to \eqref{eqn:Q reduced}. In Lemma \ref{lem:tangent conformal}, given a solution to \eqref{eqn:Q reduced} we are free to add any real multiple of $\tilde{b}^i$, which we know from \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential} is
\[
\tilde{b}^i(ζ) = \frac{1}{2}s^i + \frac{1}{2}\bar{s}^i ζ.
\]
This is exactly the freedom to choose a value of $\Re \dot{α}$. It is somewhat suggestive to note that if $α$ moves along an arc of constant $x$ then $\Re \dot{α}(1-α^2)^{-1}$ is zero, while if it moves along an arc of constant $δ$ then it is $\Im \dot{α}(1-α^2)^{-1}$ that vanishes. Thus the coefficients of $Q$ are not only determining an infinitesimal deformation, they are doing so in a manner that aligns with the geometric properties of the harmonic map.

Finally, there is a formula to compute the energy of harmonic map from its spectral data, given in \cite[Thm 12.17]{Hitchin1990}. In the non-conformal case
\[
E = \frac{4i}{P_0} (b_2 \tilde b_0 - \tilde b_2 b_0).
\]
In the genus zero case, the coefficients of the polynomials $b$ and $\tilde{b}$ are entirely determined by the choice of four integers $n,m,\tilde n, \tilde m$ and a point $α$ in the unit disc, as in \eqref{eqn:genus zero differential}. After substitution and simplication, one arrives at
\[
E = \pi^2(1+α\bar{α})\frac{m\tilde n - n\tilde m}{\abs{1-α^2}}.
\]
One can interpret the fraction as giving the area of the domain of the map, this is the `area' of the parallelogram spanned by the differentials. The factor $1+α\bar{α}$ may be seen as a measure of how far the map is from being conformal. If we compute the derivative of this expression, we observe that
\[
\dot E = 0 \Rightarrow \left(\Re α\right)\left( \Re \frac{\dot{α}}{1-α^2} \right) = 0.
\]
The left factor corresponds to the imaginary axis. The right factor corresponds to a circle centered on the real axis that cuts the unit circle perpedicularly. In other words, $\dot E$ is zero precisely when $α$ moves on an arc that preserves $τ$. This is because, for a given conformal class, harmonic maps are minimisers for the energy.
