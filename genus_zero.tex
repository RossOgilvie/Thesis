\section{Genus Zero}
\label{sec:Genus Zero}
\subsection{Computations}

In this case there are no periods to consider, so the differentials are exact. We can be super explicit.
\begin{align*}
\eta^2 &= -\bar\alpha \zeta^2 + (1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta - \alpha \\
q^i &= (a^i - \bar a^i \zeta^{-1})\eta + \pi i k \\
a^i &= \frac{\pi}{2}\left( \frac{n^i}{r} + i \frac{m^i}{s} \right) \\
r &= \sqrt{1 + \alpha\bar\alpha + \alpha + \bar\alpha} \\
s &= \sqrt{1 + \alpha\bar\alpha - \alpha - \bar\alpha} \\
dq^i &= \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta^2\eta} \left( -a^i\bar\alpha\zeta^3 + \frac{1}{2}a^i(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta^2 + \frac{1}{2}\bar a^i(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta  - \alpha\bar a^i\right) \\
\dot q^i &= \frac{1}{\zeta\eta}(\zeta^2-1)\left[ \zeta(-\bar\alpha\dot a^i - \frac{1}{2} a^i \dot{\bar\alpha}) + (-\alpha\dot {\bar a}^i - \frac{1}{2} \bar a^i \dot\alpha) \right]\\
Q &= i \frac{\pi^2}{4}\frac{1}{rs}(n^1m^2-n^2m^1) \left[ \bar\alpha 2\Re \frac{\dot\alpha}{1-\alpha^2}\zeta^2 - \frac{1}{2}(1-\alpha\bar\alpha)2i\Im \frac{\dot\alpha}{1-\alpha^2} \zeta - \alpha 2\Re \frac{\dot\alpha}{1-\alpha^2}\right]
\end{align*}

In the genus zero case, there is only one plane of meromorphic differentials, and the closing condition restricts to the integral lattice generated by
\begin{align*}
-\frac{\pi}{2r}\bar\alpha\zeta^3 + \frac{1}{2}\frac{\pi}{2r}(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta^2 +& \frac{1}{2}\frac{\pi}{2r}(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta  - \alpha\frac{\pi}{2r} \\
-i\frac{\pi}{2s}\bar\alpha\zeta^3 + \frac{1}{2}i\frac{\pi}{2s}(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta^2 +& \frac{1}{2}\bar i\frac{\pi}{2s}(1+\alpha\bar\alpha)\zeta  - \alpha\bar i\frac{\pi}{2s}
\end{align*}

It appears prima facia that there is more than one plane of differentials, since a real cubic polynomial has 4 real parameters, but the restiction of having no residues gives the relation
\[
b^i_1 = \frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{P_0}b^i_0
\]
which cuts out 2 real parameters leaving the single plane available. So we could instead think of the plane generated by the lowest order terms in the Taylor expansion, that correspond to the coefficents of the second order poles at zero, namely
\[
\Z\{\frac{\pi}{2r}, \frac{\pi}{2s}\}
\]

Because this is a lattice, it is discrete, so there is no possible variation of $b^i$ without varying $\alpha$. Indeed as you can see, everything is given ultimately in terms of $\alpha$ and the four integers $n^1,m^1,n^2,m^2$. So a variation in this case is exactly a variation of $\alpha$. Looking at $Q$ we see that is essentially contains the information of $\dot\alpha$. In particular, we know that as $\alpha$ is varied, $\tau$ moves on a geodesic in the hyperbolic plane, and it approaches infinity as $\alpha$ approaches $1$ or $-1$, which explains the scale factor. At a fixed $\alpha$, we see from the form of $Q$ that $Q_0$ can only take values on a real line, which comes from the fact $\tau$ is restricted to an arc.

\subsection{Energy in the genus zero case}
Hitchin has a formula for the energy, given in Theorem 13.17. In the non-conformal case if the differentials are expanded as
\[
\Theta = \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta^2}(\theta_{-2} + \theta_0\zeta^2 + \dots)
\]
and similiarly for $\tilde \Theta$ then the energy is given as $E = 4i(\theta_0 \tilde \theta_{-2} - \tilde \theta_0 \theta_{-2})$. Our preferred form for the differentials is
\[
  \Theta = \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta^2\eta}b(\zeta)
\]
for a polynomial $b$ of degree $g+3$, where $g$ is the genus of the spectral curve $\eta^2 = P(\zeta)$. About $\zeta=0$, there is a series expansion for $\eta$ (subscripts denoting coefficients of a series or polynomial)
\[
  1/\eta \sim \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_0}}\left(1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{P_0}\zeta + \frac{3P_1^2 - 4P_0P_2}{8P_0^2}\zeta^2\dots\right)
\]
and so we have
\[
  \Theta \sim \frac{d\zeta}{\zeta^2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{P_0}}\left[ b_0 + \zeta\left( b_1 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{P_0}b_0 \right) + \zeta^2\left( b_2 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{P_0}b_1 + \frac{3P_1^2 - 4P_0P_2}{8P_0^2}b_0 \right) + \dots\right]
\]
from which we see that $\theta_{-2} = b_0 / \sqrt P_0$ and that
\[
  \theta_0 = \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_0}}\left[b_2 - \frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{P_0}b_1 + \frac{3P_1^2 - 4P_0P_2}{8P_0^2}b_0\right] = \frac{1}{\sqrt{P_0}}\left[b_2 - A b_0\right]
\]
for some constant $A$, using the fact that $\Theta$ has no residues to eliminate $b_1$. Putting this into the energy formula, we arrive at the following version
\[
  E = \frac{4i}{P_0} (b_2 \tilde b_0 - \tilde b_2 b_0)
\]
Now we specialise to the genus zero case. Here, the $b$ polynomial is only degree $3$ and so the reality condition forces $b_2 = \bar b_1$, which is itself a multiple of $\bar b_0$. But we can be even more explict that this. If we choose integers $n,m,\tilde n, \tilde m$ and a root $\alpha$ in the unit disc, then we write
\begin{align*}
r &= \sqrt{ 1 + \alpha\bar \alpha + \alpha + \bar \alpha} \\
s &= \sqrt{ 1 + \alpha\bar \alpha - \alpha - \bar \alpha} \\
a &= \frac{\pi}{2}\left( \frac{n}{r} + i\frac{m}{s} \right) \\
\tilde a &= \frac{\pi}{2}\left( \frac{\tilde n}{r} + i\frac{\tilde m}{s} \right)\\
b_0 &= - \alpha \bar a \\
\tilde b_0 &= - \alpha \bar{\tilde a} \\
P(\zeta) &= -\alpha + (1+\alpha\bar \alpha)\zeta - \bar \alpha\zeta^2 \\
& \\
E &= 4i \frac{1}{P_0}\frac{1}{2}\frac{P_1}{\overline P_0}\frac{\pi^2}{4}\frac{-2i}{rs}(m\tilde n - n\tilde m) \\
&= \pi^2\frac{P_1}{rs}(m\tilde n - n\tilde m)
\end{align*}
A reasonable question to ask is, if one has a path of spectral data (in this case a choice of four integers and a path $\alpha(t)$), when does this path preserve the energy of the corresponding harmonic maps?
\[
\dot E = 0 \Rightarrow \left(\Re \alpha\right)\left( \Re \frac{\dot \alpha}{1-\alpha^2} \right) = 0
\]
The left factor corresponds to the imaginary axis. The second factor corresponds to a circle centered on the real axis that cuts the unit circle perpedicularly. In other words, $\dot E$ is zero precisely when $\alpha$ moves on an arc that preserves $\tau$; such arcs form a family of hyperbolic geodesics that foliate the unit disc. This was certainly necessary, as harmonic maps are energy minimisers for a given conformal class.

Below is a plot of the energy as a function over $\alpha = x + i y$. There are obvious singularities at $\alpha=1,-1$, which is the limit as the torus we are mapping from becomes infinitely stretched. The arcs mentioned above are level curves for this graph.

\end{axis}

\end{center}

\subsection{Map}
\label{sub:Map}
Starting with Hitchin formula for the general rational harmonic map
\begin{align*}
f(z) = \exp( &-(z + e^{\iu θ}\bar{z})φ + (\bar{z} + e^{-\iu θ}z)φ^* ) \\
&\cdot \exp( -(z - e^{\iu θ}\bar{z})φ + (\bar{z} - e^{-\iu θ}z)φ^* ),
\end{align*}
for phase $e^{\iu θ}$, constant $sl_2\C$ matrix $φ$ and $z\in \C/\langle 1,τ \rangle$ the parameter on the torus. Introduce $μ = e^{\iu θ/2}$ and change coordinate to $w = μ^{-1}z$. We write $w$ as real and imaginary parts $w_R + \iu w_I$.
\[
f(w) = \exp( -2w_R (μφ - \bar{μ}φ^*) ) \cdot \exp( -2\iu w_I (μφ + \bar{μ}φ^*)  ).
\]
Recall that $sl_2\C$ can be decomposed into $su_2 \oplus \iu su_2$. Write $μφ = X + \iu Y$ for $X,Y\in su_2$
\[
f(w) = \exp( -4w_R X ) \cdot \exp( 4 w_I Y  ).
\]
Consider the standard basis of $su_2$
\[
σ_1 = \begin{pmatrix}
\iu & 0 \\ 0 & -\iu
\end{pmatrix}, \;
σ_2 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & 1 \\ -1 & 0
\end{pmatrix}, \;
σ_3 = \begin{pmatrix}
0 & \iu \\ \iu & 0
\end{pmatrix},
\]
that identifies it with $\R^3$ so that we may discuss notions of length and angle. In particular, given an $su_2$ matrix $Z$, $\exp Z = I$ when $\abs{Z} \in 2π\Z$. From the above form of the map we may read off the period lattice of the torus; it is generated by
\[
-\frac{2π}{4\abs{X}}, \iu \frac{2π}{4\abs{Y}}
\]
We can now see the roles of $μ$, $\abs{X}$ and $\abs{Y}$, they determine the conformal type $τ$ and the number of windings of the map onto its image. They must be chosen so that $z=1,τ$ are mapped onto lattice points in the $w$ plane. That is, there must be integers $n,m,\tilde{n},\tilde{m}$
\[
μ = \frac{π}{2} \bra{ \frac{n}{\abs{X}} + \iu \frac{m}{\abs{Y}} },\;\;
μτ = \frac{π}{2} \bra{ \frac{\tilde{n}}{\abs{X}} + \iu \frac{\tilde{m}}{\abs{Y}} }
\]
We still have not used our freedom of rotation in $SU(2)$. We may use it to align $X,Y$  along certain axes. We rotate so that $X$ is in the direction of $σ_2$ and $Y$ lies in the plane spanned by $σ_2$ and $σ_3$. If $δ$ is the angle between $X$ and $Y$ then
\[
Y = \abs{Y} \begin{pmatrix}
0 & e^{\iu δ} \\ -e^{-\iu δ} & 0
\end{pmatrix}
\]
The holonomy matrix is
\[
H(ζ) = \exp (- μ^2φ + \bar{μ}^2φ^* - ζ^{-1}φ + ζ φ^*)
\]
from which we can compute the log of its eigenvalues as
\[
\log μ = \frac{1}{2}
\]
\[
α = \frac{-1 + xe^{\iu δ}}{1 + xe^{\iu δ}}
\]
\[
x = \abs{Y}/\abs{X}
\]
