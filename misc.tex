COMPUTATION OF T AT U OR V INFINITY


Returning to the specific form of the equation, one could draw a distinction between $u$ as a parameter, simply labeling a point, and $u$ as a coordinate, an assignment of a value to a point. $u$ is a parameter when it is $\infty$ but not a coordinate. A coordinate for this point would be $u' := 1/u$. To give a complete definition of $T$, it is necessary to give a formula in neighbourhoods of both $u=\infty$ and $v=\infty$. But because of the periods, it is impossible to give one that agrees with the formula above everywhere they are both defined. Instead, we shall define functions $T'$ and $T''$ that differ locally from $T$ by a multiple of the periods

To see explicitly how to do make this definition, let us consider the limit of $T$ as $v$ goes to infinity.
\begin{align}
\lim_{v\to+\infty} 2π\iu T
&= 4pE \lim_{v\to\infty} \tilde{F}(\iu v) - 4pK \lim_{v\to\infty} \bra{ \tilde{E}(\iu v) + \iu \frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} }
- 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - \lim_{v\to\infty} 4\iu K \frac{ w(\iu u)}{u-v} \\
&= 4\iu pEK' - 4pK \lim_{v\to\infty} \bra{ \tilde{E}(\iu v) - \iu k v + \iu k v + \iu \frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} }
- 4\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right]\\
&= 4\iu pEK' -4\iu pK(K' - E') - 4pK \lim_{v\to\infty} \bra{\iu k v + \iu \frac{w(\iu v)}{u-v} }
- 4\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right]\\
&= 2π\iu p - 4\iu pK \lim_{v\to\infty} \frac{kuv - kv^2 + w(\iu v)}{u-v}
- 4\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right]\\
&= 2π\iu p + 4\iu pK ku - 4\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right]
\end{align}
And from the other side of $v=\infty$,
\begin{align}
\lim_{v\to-\infty} 2π\iu T
&= -2π\iu p + 4\iu pK ku - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right]
\end{align}
We see that the two limits of $T$ differ by a value of $2 p$, twice the period $p$. On this neighbourhood of $v=\infty$, let $v' = 1/v$ be a coordinate on $\RInf\setminus \{0\}$. Therefore define
\[
T'(k,u,v') =
\begin{cases}
T(k,u, v) & \text{ for } v' > 0 \\
\lim_{v\to +\infty} T(k,u,v) & \text{ for } v' = 0 \\
2p + T(k,u, v) & \text{ for } v' < 0
\end{cases}.
\]
Looking specifically at this last formula, where $v' < 0$, we can rearrange it in the following way.
\begin{align}
2π\iu& (2p + T)\\
&= 4p \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu v) - K \tilde{E}(\iu v) \right] - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - 4\iu K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} + 8\iu p \bra{EK' + K(E' - K')} \\
&= 4p \left[ E (2\iu K' + \tilde{F}(\iu v)) - K (2\iu (K'-E') + \tilde{E}(\iu v)) \right] - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - 4\iu K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} \\
&= 4p \left[ E \left\{2\iu K' + \tilde{F}(\iu v)\right\} - K \left\{ 2\iu (K'-E') + \tilde{E}(\iu v)) - ikv\right\} \right] - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - 4\iu K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} - 4p\iu k K v
\end{align}
Compare this to $T'$ for $v' = 0$
\begin{align}
2π\iu T'
&= 2π\iu p + 4\iu pK ku - 4\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] \\
&= 4p \left[ E \left\{\iu K'\right\} - K \left\{ \iu (K'-E')\right\} \right] - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] + 4\iu pK ku
\end{align}
and for $v' > 0$
\[
2π\iu T' = 4p \left[ E \left\{\tilde{F}(\iu v)\right\} - K \left\{ \tilde{E}(\iu v)) - ikv\right\} \right] - 4 \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - 4\iu K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} - 4p\iu k K v
\]
In APPENDIX \todo{add ref} it was shown that the functions appearing in the braces of these equations defined above piecewise on each of $v' >0$, $v' = 0$ and $v' < 0$ were in fact  analytic in $v'$ when taken together. The second term is independent of $v'$ and so passes muster as well. It therefore remains to show that the leftovers form an analytic function. More precisely, that the following is an analytic function of $v'$.
\[
g :=
\begin{cases}
\frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} + p k v & \text{ for } v' \neq 0 \\
pku & \text{ for } v' = 0 \\
\end{cases}.
\]

\begin{align}
\frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v} + p k v
&= \frac{pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u) + pkuv - pkv^2}{u-v} \\
&= p \frac{w(\iu v) - kv^2}{u-v} + p \frac{kuv}{u-v} + \frac{w(\iu u)}{u-v} \\
&= p \frac{1}{v'}\frac{\sqrt{(1+(v')^2)(k^2 + (v')^2)} - k }{uv'-1} + p \frac{ku}{uv'-1} + \frac{v' w(\iu u)}{uv'-1},
\end{align}
which is analytic as the difference $\sqrt{(1+(v')^2)(k^2 + (v')^2)} - k$ vanishes quadratically in $v'$ near $v'=0$, and so too does the third term. In summary we have shown that $T'$ is an analytic function on the part of the parameter space with $v=\infty$ (in particular a neighbourhood of this point), and by its definition it differs from $T$ locally up to a constant where they are both defined ($v' \neq 0$). We may also define $T''$ on a neighbourhood of $u = \infty$ with local coordinate $u' = 1/u$ in an alike manner.
\[
T''(k,u',v) =
\begin{cases}
T(k,u, v) & \text{ for } u' > 0 \\
\lim_{u\to +\infty} T(k,u,v) & \text{ for } u' = 0 \\
-2 + T(k,u, v) & \text{ for } v' < 0
\end{cases}.
\]
Due to the symmetry between $u$ and $v$ inherent in the definition of $T$, the the same argument applies to this case too. There is no need to consider the possibility of both $u=v=\infty$ because on the parameter space $u\neq v$. In practical terms, it does not really matter which version of the function we use, as for our purposes they will be mostly equivalent. For example, their derivatives are identical. One needs only to be careful when talking about a particular level set that one adjusts for the different values.















\subsection{The Cut space}
THIS PART COMPUTES T AS k TO 0 AND 1

Fix a value of $p \leq 1$.

Consider the parameter space $P$ for this fixed value of $p$. Topologically it is a fattened annulus. Suppose we make a cut along the plane $u=\infty$. Now we have a box $B = \{(k,u,v)\mid 0 < k <1, u \in \R , v \in\RInf, u \neq v\}$. Our aim will be to examine the moduli space within this box, given as the level surfaces $T=q$ for rational $q$, by sweeping through it with a height function $u$. To apply Morse theory, we require the height function to be proper map and so we will need to compactify this space. The preimage of a compact range $V$ of $u$ is just $(0,1)\times \R\cup\{\infty\}\times V \setminus \{u=v\} $, so we need to close in the $k$ and $v$ directions but not as $u\to\pm\infty$. Define $\overline{B} = \bigcup_{u\in\R} \{(k,u,v)\mid 0 \leq k \leq 1, v \in [u^+, \infty] \cup [\infty, u^-] \}$ where the range of $v$ is constructed by the following process: take $\R\cup\{\infty\}$, cut out $u$ to make an open interval, and then take the two point compactification where we add $u^+$ and $u^-$ on the ends. Let us now examine the behaviour of the function as we approach the boundary of the box.
\todo{diagram this weird ass thing}

\todo{talk about how we can do level sets of a function only locally defined. talk about how because the box is simply connected, we can specify a value at a point and its level set is a well defined object even if we have to switch formulas for $T$ and `change' the value as we move around}

For $k\in(0,1)$ as $v$ approaches $u$ from either above or below, the $1/(u-v)$ factor causes $T \to \pm\infty$. If $k \to 0$ then the period terms disappear and $T$ limits to an elementary function, namely
\[
T(0,u,v) = - 2π\iu \frac{p \sqrt{1+v^2} + \sqrt{1+u^2}}{u-v}.
\]
That leaves only the limit $k \to 1$. This one is more interesting. We arrange the terms into the $p$ and non-$p$ parts.
\[
2π\iu T
= p \left\{ 4E \tilde{F}(\iu v) - 4 K \left[ \tilde{E}(\iu v) + \iu\frac{ w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right] \right\}  - \left\{ 4 E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - 4 K \left[ \tilde{E}(\iu u) + \iu\frac{ w(\iu u)}{v-u} \right] \right\}.
\]
The braced expressions only differ by interchanging $u$ and $v$, so we may treat just one. The limit of $4E \tilde{F}(\iu v)$ is $4 \times 1 \times i\atan v$, but the presence of the $K$ makes the other part difficult, as $K$ tends to $\infty$ as $k\to 1$. We divide it in the following way to compute the limit.
\begin{align}
4 K \left[ \tilde{E}(\iu v) + \iu\frac{ w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right]
&= 4 K \left[ \tilde{E}(\iu v) - \iu k v + \iu k v - \iu v + \iu v +\iu \frac{1+v^2}{u-v} - \iu \frac{1+v^2}{u-v} + \iu\frac{ w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right] \\
&= 4 K \left[ \tilde{E}(\iu v) - \iu k v \right] + 4 \iu v K (k - 1) + 4\iu K \left[\frac{uv + 1}{u-v} \right] - 4\iu K \left[ \frac{1+v^2 - w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right]
\end{align}
We shall treat each term in turn. $K (-\iu \tilde{E}(\iu v) - kv)$ tends to $0$, independent of $v$. This comes from the inequality \ref{eqn:tildeEatInf} derived in the first appendix:
\[
-(K'-E') \leq -\iu \tilde{E}(\iu u) - ku \leq K' - E'.
\]
If we multiply this by $K$, then the upper bound is $K(K' - E')$ and using Legendre's \todo{name?} relation
\[
\lim_{k\to 1} K (K'-E')
= \lim_{k\to 1} KK'- KE' -K'E + K'E
= \lim_{k\to 1} -\frac{π}{2} + K'E
= -\frac{π}{2} + K(0)E(1) = 0.
\]
The same calculation shows the lower bound tends to zero as well. The next term, $K (k - 1)$, is also zero by Lemma \ref{lem:lim(1-k)K}. We shall leave the third term momentarily, and proceed to the forth.
\begin{align*}
K \left[\frac{1+v^2 - w(\iu v)}{u-v} \right]
&= K \frac{1+v^2 - \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)v^2 + k^2v^4}}{u-v} \\
&= K \frac{(1+v^2)^2 - (1 + (1+k^2)v^2 + k^2v^4)}{(u-v)\bra{1+v^2 + \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)v^2 + k^2v^4}}} \\
&= K \frac{(1-k^2) v^2 (1+v^2)}{(u-v)\bra{1+v^2 + \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)v^2 + k^2v^4}}} \\
&= (1-k)K \frac{(1+k) v^2 (1+v^2)}{(u-v)\bra{1+v^2 + \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)v^2 + k^2v^4}}},
\end{align*}
which also goes to zero by Lemma \ref{lem:lim(1-k)K}. Hence the limit of $T$ is
\begin{align*}
\lim_{k\to 1} 2π\iu T
&= p \left\{ 4\iu \atan v - \lim_{k\to 1} 4\iu K \frac{uv+1}{u-v} \right\}
- \left\{ 4 \iu \atan u - \lim_{k\to 1} 4\iu K \frac{uv+1}{v-u} \right\} \\
&= 4\iu p \atan v - 4 \iu \atan u - 4\iu(1+p) \lim_{k\to 1} K \frac{uv+1}{u-v}.
\end{align*}


In the limit, $K$ has a logarithmic singularity. This could be canceled out if simultaneously $uv \to -1$, but otherwise it causes $T$ to tend to either positive or negative infinity. This line $\{k=1, v = -1/u\}$ where the limit is not well defined is therefore of particular interest. We shall change coordinates to examine this limit closely. Note at $u=0$ that $v$ is not a coordinate on a neighbourhood of this line. Let us change to $v'$ then and as above consider $T'$ which analytic in this coordinate.
\begin{align}
\lim_{k\to1} T' =
2π\iu p - 4\iu p \atan v' - 4 \iu \atan u - \lim_{k\to 1} 4\iu K (1+p)\frac{u+v'}{uv'-1}.
\end{align}
Consider for small positive $ε$ the family of surfaces indexed by a real number $λ$ defined parametrically in $(ε,ψ)$ by
\[
k = 1 - \exp \bra{-1/ε},\; u = ψ,\; v' = \frac{ψ+ελ}{εψλ - 1}.
\]
Along such a surface, $ε\to 0$ as $k\to 1$ and the limiting value of $T'$ is
\[
T' \to
2π\iu p + 4\iu (p-1) \atan ψ - 2\iu (1+p)λ.
\]
So by adjusting the direction of approach by varying $λ$, $T'$ in a neighbourhood of this line attains every value. It is clear from the above that $B$ is not suitable on its own to be the ambient space when doing Morse theory because $T$ is badly behaved on the boundary. To properly understand the behaviour of level sets of $T$, we should `blowup' the line $\{k=1, v' = -u\}$ so these surfaces do not have a common intersection and so that $T$ has a well defined limit on this boundary.  Instead, we will think of $B$ as one coordinate patch of a larger manifold $M$ on which $T$ is well defined. A second coordinate patch shall be given in terms of $(ε,ψ,λ)$ for $ε\in (-1,1)$, $ψ \in \R$ and $λ\in \R$. For $ε>0$,
\begin{align}
k &= 1 - \exp\bra{-\frac{1}{ε}}
    & ε &= -1/ \ln (1-k) \\
u &= ψ
    & ψ &= u \\
v' &= \frac{ψ+ελ}{εψλ - 1}
    & λ &= -\ln (1-k) \frac{u+v'}{uv'-1}
\end{align}
describes the transition between the two patches. We will work towards giving $T'$ a smooth extension to the manifold $M$. The theorem we intend to use is due to Seeley \cite{Seeley1964}: a smooth function in a half space where it and all its derivatives have continuous limits to the boundary can be extended to the whole space. Results in Appendix \ref{app:Extension} demonstrated a large class of functions that are extendable, so we can now apply those to the real thing. The calculations of the derivatives of $T$ are relatively mechanical though fairly long. There is only one point of that calculation that is worth elaborating upon. In the formula for $T$ one can conceptualise it into three groupings. There are two groupings, dubbed the `period terms' that arise from the parts of the differentials that generate the periods, one group coming from the integration over $γ_+$ and the other from $γ_-$. Each group is a function $k$ and one of either $u$ or $v$. The third group is an elementary term, and is made of leftovers that give the differentials in the correct symmetries. The period terms have an interesting derivative with respect to $k$, because there is a lot of cancellation that completely remove incomplete integrals.

Let $f(k,z) = E(k)\tilde{F}(z; k) - K(k)\tilde{E}(z; k)$. Then
\begin{align*}
\Partial{f}{k}
&= E_k \tilde{F} - K_k \tilde{E} + E\tilde{F}_k - K\tilde{E}_k \\
&= \frac{1}{k}E \tilde{F} - \frac{1}{k}K \tilde{F} - \frac{1}{k(1-k^2)}E \tilde{E} + \frac{1}{k}K \tilde{E} + \frac{1}{k(1-k^2)}E \tilde{E} - \frac{1}{k}E \tilde{F} - \frac{kz}{1-k^2}\sqrt{\frac{1-z^2}{1-k^2z^2}}E - \frac{1}{k}K\tilde{E} + \frac{1}{k}K\tilde{F} \\
&= - \frac{kz}{1-k^2}\sqrt{\frac{1-z^2}{1-k^2z^2}}E
\end{align*}

In the interest of having manageable formulae, we recall the definition of $w(z)^2 = (1-z^2)(1-k^2 z^2)$. Using primes to indicate coordinates at infinity, ie $z' = 1/z$, not derivatives, we introduce $w'(z)^2 = (1- z^2)(k^2 - z^2)$. As $\tilde F(z;k)$ and $\tilde E(z;k)$ are parameter integrals in $z$, we have that
\[
\Partial{}{u}\tilde F(\iu u; k) = \frac{\iu}{w(\iu u)},\;\;\;
\Partial{}{u}\tilde E(\iu u; k) = \iu\frac{1+k^2 u^2}{w(\iu u)},
\]
and
\[
\Partial{}{u} w(\iu u)
= \Partial{}{u} \sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+k^2 u^2}
= \frac{(1+k^2)u + 2k^2 u^3}{w(\iu u)}.
\]
The other derivatives of elliptic integrals are calculated in appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic Integrals}.
\begin{align*}\label{dTdk}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{k}
&= \frac{1}{k(1-k^2)}\frac{1}{u-v} \left[ p \sqrt { \frac{1+v^2}{1+k^2v^2}} + \sqrt { \frac{1+u^2}{1+k^2u^2} } \right] \left[ -(1+k^2uv) E + (1-k^2)K \right]
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}\label{dTds}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{u}
= -\frac{E}{w(\iu u)} + \frac{pK w(\iu v)}{(u-v)^2} + \frac{K}{w(\iu u)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdt}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v}
= \frac{pE}{w(\iu v)} - \frac{K w(\iu u)}{(u-v)^2} - \frac{pK}{w(\iu v)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdt'}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v'}
= -\frac{pE}{w'(\iu v')} + \frac{K w(\iu u)}{(uv'-1)^2} + \frac{pK}{w'(\iu v')(uv'-1)^2}\left[1 + k^2u^2 - uv' + k^2uv' + (v')^2 + u^2(v')^2 \right]
\end{equation}

Let us focus on the polynomials in the square brackets. We reuse the idea of a dominant and remainder for $k^2$. Define $\rem(k^2) = k^2 - 1$. Unlike for $\rem(K)$, we can be very explicit about $\rem(k^2)$, namely it is $(2-\exp(-1/ε))\exp(-1/ε)$, and so because of the $\exp(-1/ε)$ factor both $ε^{-n}\rem(k^2)$ and $ε^{-n}K\rem(k^2)$ are in $\mathcal{F}$ (a set of extendable functions, see Appendix \ref{sec:Extension Calculations}). \todo{FIX}

Plugging in the $(k,u,v')$-derivatives to the chain rule and ripping apart and rearranging pieces as necessary to get into a well behaved terms, we arrive at
\begin{align*}
\Partial{T'}{ε}
&=
C \bra{p\sqrt{\frac{1+(v')^2}{k^2 + (v')^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{1+s^2}{1 + k^2s^2}}}\bra{\frac{1}{ε}\frac{E}{k(1+k)} - K}
+ Cp\frac{s^2+1}{(Cεs-1)^2}\frac{1}{w'(\iu v')}E
\\&
- \frac{1}{k}\frac{v'}{uv'-1}\bra{p\sqrt{\frac{1+(v')^2}{k^2 + (v')^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{1+s^2}{1 + k^2s^2}}}\frac{1}{ε^2}K\exp(-1/ε)
\\&
+ \frac{1}{k(1+k)}\frac{1}{uv'-1}\bra{p\sqrt{\frac{1+(v')^2}{k^2 + (v')^2}} + \sqrt{\frac{1+s^2}{1 + k^2s^2}}}uEε^{-2}\rem(k^2)
\\&
- Cp \frac{s^2+1}{(Cεs-1)^2}\frac{1}{w'(\iu v')}\frac{uv'+u^2}{uv'-1}K\rem(k^2)
- C \frac{s^2}{w(\iu u)}K\rem(k^2)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\Partial{T'}{s}
&=
-\frac{1}{w(\iu u)} E + p \frac{1+C^2ε^2}{(Cεs-1)^2}\frac{1}{w'(\iu v')}E
\\&
- p\sqrt{\frac{1+(v')^2}{k^2 + (v')^2}} \frac{Cεs-1}{(1+s^2)^2}Cεs K\rem(k^2)
- p\sqrt{\frac{1+(v')^2}{k^2 + (v')^2}} \frac{(Cεs-1)^2}{(1+s^2)^2}(1+k) K \exp(-1/ε)
\\&
+ \sqrt{\frac{1+s^2}{1 + k^2s^2}} \frac{Cεs-1}{(1+s^2)^2}Cεs K\rem(k^2)
+ \sqrt{\frac{1+s^2}{1 + k^2s^2}} \frac{1+C^2ε^2}{(1+s^2)^2}s^2(1+k) K \exp(-1/ε)
\end{align*}

\begin{align*}
\Partial{T'}{C}
&=
\frac{s^2+1}{(Cεs-1)^2}\left[ \frac{p}{w'(\iu v')}εE - \frac{w(\iu u)}{(uv'-1)^2}εK - p\frac{1+k^2u^2 -uv' + k^2uv' + (v')^2 + u^2(v')^2}{w'(\iu v')(uv'-1)^2}εK \right]
\end{align*}

We can see that each of these derivatives is a combination of extendable functions. Thus $T'$ meets the conditions and so has a smooth extension to $ε<0$. Having extended past this plane of $ε=0$, we now wish to chop it off. We check that level sets of $T'$ are transverse to the plane. Once we have established this, then we can apply the sequence of lemmas culminating in \ref{lem:stratified_level_set} to conclude that the level sets are a Whitney stratified space. We can determine whether or not the level surfaces are transverse by checking that the $v'$ derivative of $T'$ is non-zero. And what have we just done if not calculated the limits of the derivatives of $T'$?

In particular, look at the limit of the $C$ derivative as $ε\to 0^+$.
\[
\lim_{ε\to 0^+}\Partial{T'}{C}
=
\frac{s^2+1}{1}\left[ \frac{p}{1+s^2}\times 0 - \frac{1+s^2}{(1+s^2)^2}\times \frac{1}{2} - p\frac{(1+s^2)^2}{(1+s^2)^3}\times\frac{1}{2} \right] = -\frac{1}{2}(p+1)
\]
which is never zero and so the level sets are always transverse to the plane $ε=0$. This derivative also matches up with the $C$ derivative of the limit of $T'$, as we would expect, providing a check of our calculations. \todo{tell Emma and John that I found a mistake via this check!} By continuity there is a neighbourhood $U$ of $ε=0$ such that the derivative is non-zero. And so this also provides that every level set of $T'$ in this neighbourhood is a manifold by the implicit function theorem. The space $ε\geq 0$ is a closed half space of $U$. We are now in the situation of Lemma \ref{lem:stratified_level_set} and so we can conclude that for any value of $q$, $T^{-1}(q) \cap \{ε \geq 0\}$ is a Whitney stratified space.

Having dealt with the poorly behaved $k=1$, we now turn to the opposite side of the box $B$. Looking at the formulas of the derivatives of $T$, only the $k$ is not clearly defined at $k=0$. This time we have the advantage that both $K$ and $E$ are analytic functions of $k$ near 0, so we may simply look at the relevant factors and do a series expansion.
\begin{align*}
\frac{1}{k}\bra{ - (1+k^2 uv) E + (1-k^2)K }
&= \frac{1}{k}\frac{π}{2}\bra{ - (1+k^2 uv)\bra{ 1 - \frac{1}{4}k^2 + O(k^4)}  + (1-k^2)\bra{ 1+\frac{1}{4}k^2 + O(k^4) } } \\
&= \frac{1}{k}\frac{π}{2}\bra{ - k^2(1+uv) + O(k^4) }
\end{align*}
All the formulas are well defined for $k<0$, so extension beyond $B$ is easy in this direction. We need to check that the level sets are transverse to this face also. Looking at the $v$ derivative
\begin{align*}
\left. \frac{1}{4\iu}\Partial{T}{v} \right|_{k=0}
&= \frac{pπ/2}{\sqrt{1+v^2}} - \frac{π/2 \sqrt{1+u^2}}{(u-v)^2} - \frac{pπ/2}{\sqrt{1+v^2}(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2\right] \\
&= - \frac{π}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+v^2}(u-v)^2}\bra{\sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+v^2} + p\left[1 + uv \right] } \\
\end{align*}
If $1+uv$ is positive, then this is negative. It could only be zero if $1+uv$ were negative and cancelled the square root terms. However, recalling that $p \leq 1$, we have the following estimates
\begin{align*}
\left. \frac{1}{4\iu}\Partial{T}{v} \right|_{k=0}
&\leq - \frac{π}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+v^2}(u-v)^2}\bra{\sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+v^2} + \left[1 + uv \right] } \\
&\leq - \frac{π}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+v^2}(u-v)^2}\bra{\abs{u}\abs{v} + 1 + uv } \\
&\leq - \frac{π}{2}\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+v^2}(u-v)^2}
\end{align*}
So this derivative is always negative. Similarly, checking at $v=\infty$
\begin{align}
\left. \frac{1}{4\iu}\Partial{T}{v'} \right|_{k=0,v'=0}
= \frac{π}{2} \sqrt{1+u^2}
\end{align}
So the level surfaces are transverse here as well. Hence we have checked the entire $k=0$ plane, and so entirely analogously to the $ε=0$ end, we can say in some neighbourhood of this plane that the level surfaces are genuine submanifolds by the implicit function theorem and we can apply Lemma \ref{lem:stratified_level_set} to say the truncated level surface for $k \geq 0$ is a Whitney stratified space.





Next we shall show that no where else does a level set approach the boundary of $B$. Let us consider the boundary where $0 < u - v < δ$. On this boundary, the dominant term is $1/(u-v)$ so we expect $T$ to be large and negative and that is exactly what we will show. In particular, let us consider a small neighbourhood of a strip $u_0 < u < S_1$, $k\in (0,1)$, $v=u^-$.
\begin{align*}
T
& \leq 2πp v - 4pK\asinh v - 4 \atan u + 4K u - 4K \frac{1+p}{δ} \\
& \leq 2πp v + 4K u - 4K \frac{1+p}{δ} \\
& \leq 4K \bra{ p u_1 + u_1 - \frac{1+p}{δ}}.
\end{align*}
So if $δ$ is chosen small enough, then the bracketed term is negative. One could choose it so as to make the bracket more negative than $- \abs{q} / 2π$. Thus no part of the level set $T^{-1}(q)$ lies in the volume $\Set{ (k,u,v) }{ k \in (0,1), u \in (u_0,u_1), u-δ < v < u }$. As $u_0$ and $u_1$ were arbitrary, for any given level set there is a neighbourhood of the face $v = u^-$ of $\overline{B}$ that excludes that level set, namely this neighbourhood is the union of this process over different ranges of $u$. An identical argument for $v=u^+$ show that in a neighbourhood of that face $T$ is arbitrarily large and any level set is likewise excluded on that side. This leaves only the face $k=1$ away from the exceptional line $v = -1/u$. And we have already computed the limit on this face. At every point on the face away from this line $T$ blowups. So every point has a neighborhood that on which $T$ takes value above (or below) any level. So these points too cannot be in the closure of any given level set. Taken together, these results shows what the closure of a level set is composed of. It is the level set in $B$ together with the intersection of the level set with the planes $ε=0$ and $k=0$. Moreover, subject to showing that the level set on the inside of $B$ is a submanifold, we have shown it to be a Whitney stratified space and a closed space in $\overline{B}$.
