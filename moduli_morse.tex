\subsection{Marked Point Coordinates}
\label{sub:Reformulate}

Recall the two rationality conditions that must be satisfied for a genus one spectral curve to admit differentials meeting the closing condition
\begin{align}
p &:= \frac{\abs{1-α}\abs{1-β}}{\abs{1+α}\abs{1+β}} \in \Q, \\
T &:=  \frac{1}{2π\iu} \bra{p\int_{γ_-} Θ^2 - \int_{γ_+} Θ^2} \in \Q,
\end{align}
and recall the explicit expression for $T$ in terms of the branch points $α$ and $β$
\[
T = \frac{2p}{π\iu} \left[ E F(f(-1);k) - K E(f(-1);k) \right] - \frac{2}{π \iu}\left[ E F(f(1);k) - K E(f(1);k) \right] + \frac{2}{π\iu}K \frac{\abs{1-α}\abs{1-β}}{\abs{α-β} + \abs{1-\conj{α}β}} \frac{4ν}{1-ν^2}, \labelthis{Teqn1}
\]
where $f$ is the map normalises the branch points of the spectral curve (it takes $α$ to $1$, $β$ to $k$, etc) and $ν$ is the point of intersection between the branch point circle and the unit circle. $T$ is a real valued function because $f(1)$ and $f(-1)$ are purely imaginary and $\tilde F, \tilde E$ take the imaginary axis to itself, and because $ν$ is on the unit circle so $ν/(1-ν^2)$ is purely imaginary as well.

It is our ultimate aim to examine the surfaces defined by the two conditions and ultimately we will find coordinates on those surfaces. This involves applying the implicit function theorem, the necessary computation involves differentiating the above expressions. It is therefore prudent to adopt a parameterisation of the space of spectral curves more suited to that task than $(α,β)$. An obvious first coordinate is $p$ itself, as then we can enforce the first condition simply by holding it constant. Elliptic integrals are the most difficult part of the above to differentiate, so to minimise our labour we choose the other three (real) coordinates to be $k$, $\iu u = f(1)$ and $\iu v = f(-1)$ for $u,v \in \RInf$. First we must show these do indeed parameterise the space of spectral curves. We proceed by determining a formula for the change of parameters.

Denote $z_0 = f(0)$, the image of $ζ=0$ in the $z$-plane. This is an important point, because the new parameters all represent points in the $z$-plane so we must construct the inverse transformation $f^{-1}$, which is a scalar multiple of
\[
\frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}},
\]
where we have used the real structure to locate $f(\infty) = - \conj{z_0}$. Note the following trick using cross ratios.
\[
\abs{\frac{α-1}{α+1}}
= \abs{\frac{α-1}{α+1}} \abs{\frac{0+1}{0-1}}
= \abs{ \cross{α}{0}{1}{-1} }
= \abs{ \cross{1}{z_0}{\iu u}{\iu v} }
= \abs{\frac{1-\iu u}{1 - \iu v}} \abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}}
\]
Together with a similar formula for $β$, this shows that $z_0$ lies on a particular circle
\begin{align*}
p &= \abs{\frac{1-\iu u}{1 - \iu v}}\abs{\frac{1 - k\iu u}{1 - k\iu v}} \abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}}^2 \\
\abs{\frac{z_0 - \iu v}{z_0 - \iu u}} ^2
&= p \frac{\sqrt{1+v^2}}{\sqrt{1+u^2}}\frac{\sqrt{1+k^2v^2}}{\sqrt{1+k^2u^2}} \\
&= p \frac{w(\iu v)}{w(\iu u)} \\
&=: R^2 \labelthis{eqn:z_0 circle}
\end{align*}
In the $ζ$-plane, the points $-1,0,1$ all lie on a straight line that is perpendicular to the unit circle at both $-1$ and $1$, and invariant under the real involution. Applying the M\"obius transformation $f$ we can therefore say that $\iu v, z_0, \iu u$ all lie on a circle that is perpendicular to the imaginary axis and symmetric under reflection in the imaginary axis. Let $z_0 = x+\iu y$. Then $z_0$ lies on the circle
\[
x^2 + \bra{ y - \frac{u+v}{2} }^2 = \frac{(u-v)^2}{4},
\]
which simplifies to the relation
\[
x^2 + y^2 = y(u+v) - uv.
\]
The circle in equation \ref{eqn:z_0 circle} gives that $z_0$ satisfies the relation
\[
x^2 + y^2 + 2y \frac{R^2 u - v}{1-R^2} + \frac{v^2 - R^2 u^2}{1-R^2} = 0.
\]
The solution of these two equations, the intersection of the two circles, is
\[
x = \frac{R}{1 + R^2} \abs{u-v},\; y = \frac{R^2u + v}{1+R^2}
\]
where the sign of $x$ is chosen to make $z_0$ lie in the right half of the $z$-plane. This choice amounts to choosing the branch points $α,β$ \emph{inside} the unit circle. The point with the opposite sign corresponds to $f(\infty) = -\conj{z_0}$. Having found $z_0$ in terms of $p,k,u,v$ it remains to find the correct scaling of $f^{-1}$. We use the fact that $f^{-1}(\iu u) = 1$.
\begin{align*}
f^{-1}(z) &= C \frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}} \\
1 = f^{-1}(\iu u) &= C \frac{\iu u - z_0}{\iu u + \conj{z_0}} \\
f^{-1}(z) &=  \frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0} \frac{z-z_0}{z + \conj{z_0}}
\end{align*}
Now, one can simply take $α = f^{-1}(1)$ and $β = f^{-1}(k^{-1})$ to give formula for the branch points in terms of $(p,k,u,v)$. The formula is not well defined when $z_0$ is $\iu u$, but this could only occur if $x=0$, which itself only occurs if $u=v$. The correspondence therefore excludes these values.

In the case that one of $u$ or $v$ is infinity, the formula continues to hold after taking the suitable limit. One could alternatively apply the same geometrical reasoning to above to verify this limit calculation, which we shall do now. Suppose that $u=\infty$. Then the transformation $f$ takes the line through $1,0,-1$ to a line perpendicular to the imaginary axis. This line is therefore horizontal and so $z_0$ and $\iu v$ have the same imaginary parts. This gives $y=v$ directly. Considering next $p$, the special case of the cross ratio gives that
\begin{align}
p
&= \frac{\abs{z_0 -\iu v}^2}{\abs{1-\iu v}\abs{k^{-1}-\iu v}} \\
&= \frac{x^2}{k^{-1}\sqrt{1+v^2}\sqrt{1+k^2 v^2}} \\
x &= \sqrt{\frac{p w(\iu v)}{k}}.
\end{align}
This are the same formulas that one arrives at by taking $u \to \infty$ in the previous formula for $x$ and $y$. The rest of the formula for $f^{-1}$ is as before. The calculation for $v \to \infty$ is similar.

In summary, we have found a new set of parameters $\{(p,k,u,v) \mid p \in \R^+, k \in (0,1), u,v \in\RInf, u \neq v\}$, that are in correspondence with pairs of branch points $α,β$ in the unit disc with $α\neq β$. The moduli space is a subspace of this parameter space defined implicitly by the two conditions that $p$ and $T$ are constant.

From now on we will only consider the parameter space for fixed values of $p$. Topologically it is an interval cross an annulus, a feature not easily seen from the $α,β$ description. The interval component is obvious, it comes from $k\in (0,1)$. To see the annulus part, consider the set $\{ (u,v) \in \RInf \times \RInf \mid u \neq v \}$. Topologically, $\RInf$ is just a circle $\S^1$, so this set is a subset of a torus $\S^1 \times S^1$. The line $u=v$ can be represented as the line where the toroidal and poloidal angles are equal, and removing this line leaves an annulus.

A more instructive way of visualising this space is to think of it as a solid cylinder with a line along the central axis removed. One should think of the radius of point being given by $1-k$, so that the central axis is identified with the value $k=1$. Shells of a fixed radius (slices of fixed $k$) are topologically a annulus, as one should expect. This model is useful because loops around the central axis, which is to say certain paths in the space of spectral curves, correspond to the branch points $α$ and $β$ circling one another, a correspondence which can be seen if one considers the degenerate case of $α\to β$. In this limit $k$ tends to $1$, the central axis, and the branch point circle tends to a straight line. As we move around the axis, the values of $u,v$ are moving through the values of $\RInf$. Another way to put this is that the points $μ,ν$ on the unit circle in the $ζ$-plane, which define the origin and infinity of the $z$-plane, are moving around the unit circle. Hence we infer that the branch point circle (which is a line in this degenerate case) is rotating about the point $α\sim β$, which in turn means that $α$ and $β$ are circling one another.






Having considered the benefits of these new coordinates, it is time to rewrite $T$ in terms of $(p,k,u,v)$. Particularly, we must compute the factors in the third term of $T$. By direct computation
\begin{align*}
\abs{1-α} &= \abs{\frac{(z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (\iu u - 1) }{ (\iu u - z_0) (1 + z_0) }} \\
\abs{1-β} &= \abs{\frac{(z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (k \iu u - 1) }{ (\iu u - z_0) (1 + k z_0) }} \\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\abs{α-β} &= \abs{\frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0}} \abs{\frac{(z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (k - 1) }{ (1 + z_0) (1 + k z_0) }} \\
&= \abs{\frac{(z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (k - 1) }{ (1 + z_0) (1 + k z_0) }}
\labelthis{eqn:a-b in u}
\\
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
\abs{1-\conj{α}β} &= \abs{\frac{(z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (k + 1) }{ (1 + z_0) (1 + k z_0) }}.
\end{align*}
where the expressions were simplified (such as in \ref{eqn:a-b in u}) using the observation that
\[
\abs{\frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0}} = 1,
\]
because the denominator is the conjugate of the numerator. Next $ν = f^{-1}(\infty)$ and
so
\begin{align*}
ν &= \frac{\iu u + \conj{z_0}}{\iu u - z_0} \\
\frac{1+ν}{1-ν} &= -\iu \frac{1}{R}\sign{(u-v)} \\
\frac{1-ν}{1+ν} &= \iu R\sign{(u-v)} \\
\frac{4ν}{1-ν^2} &= \frac{1+ν}{1-ν} - \frac{1-ν}{1+ν} \\
&= -\iu \frac{1+R^2}{R} \sign{(u-v)}.
\end{align*}
These expressions combine to give
\begin{align*}
\frac{\abs{1-α}\abs{1-β}}{\abs{α-β} + \abs{1-\conj{α}β}} \frac{4ν}{1-ν^2}
&= \frac{1}{2}\abs{\frac{ (z_0 + \conj{z_0}) (1 - \iu u) (1-k\iu u) }{ (\iu u - z_0)^2 }}
\times -\iu \frac{1+R^2}{R} \sign{(u-v)} \\
&= \frac{ R w(\iu u) }{ \abs{u - v}} \times -\iu \frac{1+R^2}{R} \sign{(u-v)} \\
&= -\iu \frac{ w(\iu u) }{ u - v} (1+R^2)  \\
&= -\iu \frac{ pw(\iu v) + w(\iu u) }{ u - v},
\end{align*}
and hence that
\begin{align*}
\labelthis{eqn:Teqn2}
T(p,k,u,v) = \frac{2p}{π\iu} \left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu v) - K \tilde{E}(\iu v) \right] - \frac{2}{π\iu}\left[ E \tilde{F}(\iu u) - K \tilde{E}(\iu u) \right] - \frac{2}{π} K \frac{p w(\iu v) + w(\iu u)}{u-v}.
\end{align*}

This formula is essentially correct, but there are some subtleties that must be dealt with. Particularly, this formula for $T$ is not well defined everywhere on the parameter space. This is actually a problem for the formula for $T$ in terms of $α, β$ as well and perhaps even clearer in that form. Note that when $ν = \pm 1$ the third term of \ref{eqn:Teqn1} is infinite. The corresponding point of \ref{eqn:Teqn2} is when one of $u$ or $v$ is infinite. But it is not the case that $T$ is badly behaved near these points, instead these are branch cuts of the function implicit in the method we used to specify the paths of integration $γ_+, γ_-$.

DIGRESSION TO EXPLAIN THE PERIODS, THE TRUE NATURE OF T PERHAPS LINK BACK TO THE REMARKS ABOUT THE CENTRAL AXIS. Should this go way earlier, like in the integral definition of T?
COPIED IN FROM ELSE WHERE: Geometrically this is because of how we have standardised the open paths. Recall that the $\iu v$ is the image of $-1$ under $f$, and $\infty$ corresponds to the point $ν$. The path $γ_-$ is specified to tranverse part of the unit circle from $-1$ but avoid $ν$. Hence when $ν$ crosses past $-1$, the direction of tranversal reverses. This is equivalent to adding a period (actually two periods because we traverse the arc on the unit circle twice, once before and once after going around the branch point). And in the original definition of $T$, we see this integral that is affected has a coefficient of $p$, perfectly matching what this calculation has shown. The same is true for $u$. \todo{major fix needed}












\subsection{Universal Cover of the Parameter Space}

To deal with the multivaluedness of $T$ on the parameter space $P$, we shall move to its universal cover $\tilde{P}$, on which $T$ can be realised as a single valued function $\tilde{T}$. Let the coordinates on $\tilde{P}$ be
\[
\{(k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) \in (0,1)\times\R\times\R \mid \tilde{u} < \tilde{v} < \tilde{u} + 2π \}.
\]
The projection map $p : \tilde{P} \to P$ is given by
\begin{align*}
u &= \tan \frac{\tilde{u}}{2},   \quad  u' = \tan \frac{π - \tilde{u}}{2}, \\
v &= \tan \frac{\tilde{v}}{2},   \quad  v' = \tan \frac{π - \tilde{v}}{2}, \\
k &= k.
\end{align*}
Define the winding number $N : \R \to \Z$ of a number $x$ to be the integer $N(x)$ such that $-π < x - 2πN(x) \leq π$.
\[
\tilde{T}(k,\tilde{u},\tilde{v}) = 2pN(v) - 2N(u) + T(k,u,v).
\]

































\subsection{Derivaitves}

In the interest of having manageable formulae, we recall the definition of $w(y)^2 = (1+y^2)(1+k^2 y^2)$. Using primes to indicate coordinates at infinity (ie $y' = 1/y$), not derivatives, we introduce $w'(y')^2 = (1 + (y')^2)(k^2 + (y')^2)$. As $F(z;k)$ and $E(z;k)$ are parameter integrals in $z$, we have that
\[
\Partial{}{u} F(\iu u; k) = \frac{\iu}{w(u)},\;\;\;
\Partial{}{u} E(\iu u; k) = \iu\frac{1+k^2 u^2}{w(u)},
\]
and
\[
\Partial{}{u} w(u)
= \Partial{}{u} \sqrt{1+u^2}\sqrt{1+k^2 u^2}
= \frac{(1+k^2)u + 2k^2 u^3}{w(u)}.
\]
The other derivatives of elliptic integrals are calculated in appendix \ref{sec:Elliptic Integrals}.
\begin{align*}\label{dTdk}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{k}
&= \frac{1}{k(1-k^2)}\frac{1}{u-v} \left[ p \sqrt { \frac{1+v^2}{1+k^2v^2}} + \sqrt { \frac{1+u^2}{1+k^2u^2} } \right] \left[ -(1+k^2uv) E + (1-k^2)K \right]
\end{align*}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdu}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{u}
= -\frac{E}{w(u)} + \frac{pK w(v)}{(u-v)^2} + \frac{K}{w(u)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdv}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v}
= \frac{pE}{w(v)} - \frac{K w(u)}{(u-v)^2} - \frac{pK}{w(v)(u-v)^2}\left[1 + u^2 - uv + v^2 + k^2 uv + k^2 u^2v^2 \right]
\end{equation}
\begin{equation}\label{dTdv'}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v'}
= -\frac{pE}{w'(v')} + \frac{K w(u)}{(uv'-1)^2} + \frac{pK}{w'(v')(uv'-1)^2}\left[1 + k^2u^2 - uv' + k^2uv' + (v')^2 + u^2(v')^2 \right]
\end{equation}


\begin{lem}
The functions
\[
U(x,k,u,v) := -(u-v)^2 E + xKw(u)w(v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right]
\]
and
\[
V(x,k,u,v') := -(uv'-1)^2 E + xKw(u)w'(v') + K\left[ 1 + k^2u^2 - uv' + k^2 uv' + (v')^2 + u^2 (v')^2 \right]
\]
have no zeroes for $x \geq 1$, $k\in (0,1)$, $u,v,v' \in \R$.
\begin{proof}
We shall prove this statement by showing that the two functions are in fact always positive. The first step is to eliminate $E$. From \cite{Anderson}, we have the sharp inequality $E < k^2 + (1-k^2)K$. If we apply the crude estimate that $K>1$ (in fact $K > π/2$), we see that
\[
E < k^2 + (1-k^2)K = K + k^2 (1-K) < K.
\]
Also using the assumption that $x\geq 1$, one can then begin
\begin{align*}
U(x,k,u,v)
&= -(u-v)^2 E + xKw(\iu u)w(\iu v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&> -(u-v)^2 K + Kw(\iu u)w(\iu v) + K\left[ 1 + u^2 - uv + k^2 uv + v^2 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&= K \left[ w(\iu u)w(\iu v) + 1 + (1 + k^2) uv + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right]
\end{align*}
This formula is almost sufficent. The only term that could be negative is the one featuring $uv$. However, a lower bound for the square root terms is
\[
w(u) = \sqrt{1 + (1+k^2)u^2 + k^2u^4} > \sqrt{(1+k^2)u^2} = \sqrt{(1+k^2)}\abs{u},
\]
so
\begin{align*}
U(x,k,u,v)
&> K \left[ (1+k^2)\abs{uv} + 1 + (1 + k^2) uv + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right] \\
&\geq K \left[ 1 + k^2 u^2 v^2 \right].
\end{align*}
This is positive, so $U$ is without zeroes. Taking a similar approach for $V$
\[
V(x,k,u,v') > K \left[ w(u) w'(v') + (1+k^2)uv' + k^2u^2 + (v')^2\right].
\]
In addition to the above bound for $w(u)$, we also now require a lower bound for $w'(v')$:
\[
w(v') = \sqrt{k^2 + (1+k^2)(v')^2 + (v')^4} > \sqrt{(1+k^2)(v')^2} = \sqrt{(1+k^2)}\abs{v'},
\]
which can now be applied to show that
\[
V(x,k,u,v') > K \left[k^2u^2 + (v')^2\right].
\]
This establishes that $V$ has no roots either.
\end{proof}
\end{lem}

This result is of interest because it shows that the $v$ and $v'$ derivatives of $T$ are nonzero :
\begin{align*}
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v} &= \frac{-p}{w(v)(u-v)^2} U\bra{ \frac{1}{p},k,u,v }, \\
\frac{π}{2}\Partial{T}{v'} &= \frac{p}{w'(v')(uv'-1)^2} V\bra{ \frac{1}{p},k,u,v' }.
\end{align*}
